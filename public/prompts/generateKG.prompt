I want you to act as a converter from a source paragraph in natural language to a knowledge graph. 

I will provide you with a paragraph, and you should convert it into a JSON representation of a knowledge graph. 

Your response should consist of the nodes, edges, and their relationships based on the information in the paragraph. Please use a clear and concise representation. 

Your response should use the JSON format, has a 'nodes' field consisting of a list of node names,  a 'edges' field consisting of a list of edges. Each edge should has the field 'source', 'target' and 'label', representing the source, target and relations of the edge respectively.

The nodes should include all of amount values in the paragraph. You should try to extract as much edge relations as possible.

Example: 
paragraph: Alice is Bob's roommate.

response: {nodes: ['Alice', 'Bob'], edges: [{'source': 'Alice', 'target': 'Bob', label: 'roommate'}]}

paragraph: $paragraph

response:
