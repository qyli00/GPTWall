"prompt": "Improve my resume. Hello, my name is John Smith, and this is my most recent work history. I amlooking for a position that will take my career to the next level. I've worked primarily in customer service, but I'm currently going to school to become a clinical scientist. I am a hard worker and faster learner and can get along with anybody due to my culturally diverse background. I am looking for a position that I know will challenge the skills I have acquired over the past few years.\nEducational Experience:\nLiberty College\n2021 — present\nProfessional Experience:\nCustomer Service Representative\nABC Company\nJune 2019 - August 2021\nSenior Customer Service Representative\nABC Company\nAugust 2021 - May 2023\nAccomplishments/Responsibilities:\n• Proficient in handling customer inquiries\n• Excellent communication and interpersonal skills\n• Strong problem-solving and analytical abilities\n\nDuring my time with ABC Company, I resolved complex customer issues: I consistently demonstrated my ability to handle challenging customer situations by successfully resolving complex issues. One such instance involved a frustrated customer who had been experiencing ongoing technical difficulties. Through active listening, troubleshooting, and collaboration with the technical support team, I was able to identify the root cause of the problem and provide a prompt resolution, leading to a satisfied and loyal customer.\nI also took on the responsibility of mentoring and training new team members. I developed comprehensive training materials, conducted one-on-one coaching sessions, and facilitated group training sessions. Through these efforts, I helped new hires quickly adapt to their roles, ensuring a smooth onboarding process and maintaining consistent service quality across the team.\nKey Skills: Communication",

"prompt": "Please write a summary report from the meeting note below ABC Company?\nCFO meeting with ABC Company CFO John Smith\nProduction outlook:\nFeasibility of 10 million units' production, +30% YoY. March production was 1m or so, already at the pace of 10m? What is the shortage situation?\n* Significant growth in all the markets.\n* Talked to suppliers and confirm the visibility of supply before making the plan.\n* In APAC region, we are slightly behind the plan, however.\n* Reallocate the chips from APAC to other markets.\n* Critical parts recovery is important. Some critical parts are still in short supply.\n* Some adjustments have been done to reduce dependency. No more single sourcing for criticalparts. Parts we are using are the best/latest, but we can consider using older versions\n* Look at the features/functions of the product. we reconfigure the specs.\n* Buy chips from brokers/open market (note: traceability is important for safety concerns. we canverify the traceability even through brokers)\n* In NA, we are ahead of the plan, but we are behind in APAC.\n* Q4 production growth rate should be over 20% YoY.\n* For demand side, we are pretty confident.\n* We have a plan to introduce 12 new products over 18 months, but we did 14 products. Except for one product, all others are selling well.\n* Despite the local voice saying not to launch a specific product variant in APAC, HQ went ahead. That was the only mistake. Used to sell 15k a month, but now only 1-2k a month.\n* We have an enhanced version in EU last month. So far, seeing good reception by the market.\n* In EU and Japan wait time is long, from 4 months to one year.\n* US customers don't wait, if not in stores, they buy a different product. Key is to stock up inventory in the US. Usually, 3 months stock in the US, so at least 2 months in the US.",
