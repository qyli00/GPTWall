And the creation of an anti-Islamic video\n(ironically entitled \"Innocence of Muslims\") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst\n(or excuse) for the protests.\nWhy Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed\nMost Americans operate by a different \"we.\" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly\nattack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.\nLibyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, \"I\ncondemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free\npeople everywhere.\"\n\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the\nInternet,\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. \"The United States deplores any intentional effort to\ndenigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning\nof our nation.\"\nIn a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as\"This Is Water,\" novelist David\nFoster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the \"natural, basic self-centeredness\" that puts \"me\" at the center of\nthe world.\nThis unconscious \"default setting\" fosters the sort of \"blind certainty\" that manifests as arrogant atheism and\nfundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that \"default setting\" \u2014 to\nbegin to see things from the perspectives of others.\nFollow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739590\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWallace focused in his speech on the individual \"I.\" But his critique can be applied as well to another \"default\nsetting\" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of\nGive:5\nAccording to those who stormed the embassies, \"Innocence of Muslims\" was not made by an individual\n(whoever the shadowy \"Sam Bacile\" may \u2014 or may not \u2014 be). It was made by anAmerican.\nMoreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual\nAmericans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the\nprotests turned deadly, condemning \"the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious\nfeelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\"\nCNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories\nMeanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed \"Innocence of Muslims\" are imprisoned in some\ngroupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.\nTheir film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as\ndupes.\nUnfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.\nWhen questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself\nas \"Sam Bacile\" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that \"Islam is a cancer.\"\nYou don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,\nand you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.\nI am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and\nreligion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than\noffending them with an ignorant movie.\nNonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as \"blind certainty.\"\nOur world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and\nHindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.\nNeither is it divided into secularists and people of faith \u2014 the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.\nThe real \"red line\" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent\ndays, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of\ninnocents in Libya and Egypt.\nBoth groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of \"blind certainty,\" unacquainted with both the complexity and\ncontradictions of life on Earth and the \"cloud of unknowing\" that hovers over every major religion.\nThe great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not\nknow everything.\nThey knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of\nordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying\nthe world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.\nThe killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence\nof Islam.\"\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739590\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant\nmilitary advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed \"Operation Mermaid Dawn,\" the\ntiming gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up\nactivity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently\npromoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,\ndown almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than\nthe authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for\nTripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely\nmanner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC\njust issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human\nrights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward\nthinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not\nWhile there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have\ntranslated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two\nhours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than\nhead any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance\nhere. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli\nfall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,\nwhich after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of\nhow to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do\nthe extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for\nTripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to\nthe military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)\npassing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support\nthere and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an\nalternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to\nremind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum\nthat others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.\nWe've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the\nbest solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote\nand how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and\nacts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even\nmore than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility\ncould be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would\nunderscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the\nBenghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They\nfeel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no\nmatter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that\nthe TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same\ncategory as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739732\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Tarhouni also\nacknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and\nnot a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,\nMohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is\nprepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla\nwar could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.\nAmong other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the\nreconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less\nlikely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through\nrule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained\nas part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC\nofficials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an\ninclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still\nseem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the \"gentle character\" of the Libyan people as the\nbest assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.\nBenghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation\ncommittees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension\nand gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had\npreviously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are\nnow looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and\npillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance\nto Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National\nSecurity Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist\nleanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people\nnoted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,\nagain, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was\nwidespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here\nwhen I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.\nWe also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as\nmore territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns\nor fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to\ndiscuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on\nSouth Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa\nproblem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making\nNelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out\nattending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the\nUAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way\nof getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of the\nU.S. interagency process.\nMy traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.\nI will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril\nagain in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's role\napproaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I\nneed to join Chris here in the coming days.\nChris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all\nthe work done to support my trip.

One vehicle was also burned at the compound.\nFor many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest\nproblems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the\nmultiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the\nregular armed forces and police.\nThe militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's\nrevolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals\nand carrying out killings.\nMilitias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their\nhardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which\nkilled Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\nAfter taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist\nmilitia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were\nwounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.\nEarlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on\nFriday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.\n\"No, no, to militias,\" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that\nmilitias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. \"Benghazi is in a trap,\"\nsigns read. \"Where is the army, where is the police?\"\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739766\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nOther signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, \"The ambassador was Libya's friend\" and \"Libya lost a friend.\"\nMilitary helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the\nprotesters.\nThe march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of\nQaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been\nunable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled\nthe growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.\nResidents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.\nThe anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of\nBenghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a\ndeadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.\nA significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.\nDuring the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and\nally itself with Al Qaeda.\nBut now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.\n\"The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,\" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim\npreacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio\nshow he hosts. \"We felt that the revolution is going in vain.\"\nLeaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias\ndisband.\nTribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no\nlonger have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are\nkilled.\nActivists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put\nan end to the \"state of terrorism\" created by the militias.\nMilitiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of\nelderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,\nreportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and\nassassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.\nDarna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.\nWomen wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In\nthe ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare\nWestern songs.\nAnd many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name\nmeans \"Supporters of Shariah Law.\"\n\"We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,\" said Wassam ben\nMadin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising\nagainst Qaddafi. \"This is not the time for talk about Sharjah.

We will tell\nthem you are from us and you fought for us\" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into\nthe) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.\"\nOfficials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The\narmed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.\nSo the government has created a \"High Security Committee\" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to\nintegration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average\npolice monthly salary of around $200.\nHowever, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only\nprompted more militias to form.\nOfficials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war\nagainst Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several\nhundred thousand.\n\"All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,\" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer.

John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been critical of her, but said \"some of the statements he's\nmade about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss\nall of this with him.\"\nHer comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widely\ndenounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.\n11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on\nthe anniversary.\nThe focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack\nObama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term.\nRice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: \"As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to\nappear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were\nprimarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American\ndiplomatic facilities around the world, and Iran's nuclear program.\"\nHours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-\nIslamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith\nand two former Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.\nRice said, \"The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this\" pattern.\n\"When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to\nme by the intelligence community,\" she said.\n\"I made clear that the information was preliminary, and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers,\"\nshe added.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739811\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

A25\nHEADLINE: It's not about Rice\nBYLINE: Richard Cohen\nBODY:\nIn 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a\nleftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in\nWashington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was \"soft on communism,\" and he launched an\ninvestigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his\nday.\nRice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's\nand a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having\ndone - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more\nat work.\nAt first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his\nRumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn\ncharge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\nShe had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.\nBut Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were\nwrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.\nJust as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It\nwas soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a\npost to which she has not been nominated. \"Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or\nincompetently misled the American public,\" they bellowed.\nI think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great\ndeal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some\nothers. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential\nsecretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who\nhas, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is\nchairman.\nBut the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White\nHouse and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739841\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\njob at Foggy Bottom, we cannot expect the inevitable book by her to reveal a Clinton Doctrine. For the most\npart, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy.\nSo what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease\nabout Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's\nalleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else\n(with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of\nunhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an\namorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme.\nSyria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be\ndusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become,\nbut much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee\ncalamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna\nadministration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.\nThis sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much\nmore than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He\nsees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for\nintervention, not just say it's too hard to do.\nThe attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this\ncase, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American\npower, not merely American politics.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739841\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

They are surprised to see strangers -- five women and two\nmen -- sitting in the chairs that the boys typically occupy.\nThe students find some empty seats and shrug out of their matching brown coats and mismatched scarves. They\nare curious about the visitors in a lean-back, fold-your-arms, prove-it kind of way.\n\"I'm James Forman,\" begins a 40-something man. \"I'm a professor at Georgetown Law School and -- \"\n\"You related to the James Forman?\" interrupts 17-year-old Carleto Bailey.\n\"I'm James Forman Jr.\"\n\"That your father? James Forman your dad?\" Carleto demands.\n\"Yes, I \"\n\"Wasn't he some big civil rights guy? NAACP? Or SNCC?\"\n\"SNCC,\" Forman says, seemingly surprised that Carleto has heard of his father, who was executive secretary of\nthe Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for years in the 1960s before becoming active with the Black\nPanthers.\nB6\n\"He's a good guy,\" Carleto continues. \"You tell him that.\"\nForman smiles. \"He passed a few years ago, but he would be happy to hear this,\" the professor says. He scans\nthe room. The Oak Hill students, all African American, are dressed identically in khaki pants and royal-blue\npolo shirts. They have chosen seats on the edges of the room and, after sitting down, have pushed their chairs\nback as far as possible against the wall.\nForman's Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- are in jeans and sweaters.\nThey lean forward, intent and maybe a little bit nervous. \"I teach a class on juvenile justice at the law school,\"\nForman continues. \"And I thought this would be a really good way for law students to learn about juvenile\njustice. There is a certain amount you can learn from reading, but you also need to see and experience things. So\nI thought they would learn a lot from coming out here and hearing about your experiences.\"\nCarleto raises an eyebrow. This is a new one.\n\"And the benefit for you is that they know things about the law that you don't. Ya'll have certain things you\nknow. They have certain things they know. It can be a learning opportunity for everybody.\"\nForman suggests they go around the room and share their names and an interesting fact about themselves.\nDead silence.\nHe smiles encouragingly. \"My name is James Forman, and I helped to start this organization, See Forever, that\nnow runs your school,\" he says.\nCarleto, who has been leaning back on the two rear legs of his chair, brings it down with a bang that sends his\nshort dreads swinging forward and his black plastic rectangular glasses sliding down his nose.\nA few Georgetown students jump.\nHe looks out over the top of his glasses. \"My name's Carleto Bailey,\" he says. \"My interesting fact is that I'm\nfunny./I\nHe gives a wide smile of bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak Hill student Ashawntea\nHenderson, 17, who sits next to him, rolls his eyes. But Carleto's not done: \"And I'm smart.\"\nBut as it turns out, these Georgetown folks -- like his other teachers at Oak Hill Academy -- aren't going to\naccept Carleto's assertion at face value. They want more than good grades, more than the right answers on a\nmultiple-choice test. They want him to prove that he can think.\nForman shows the group an excerpt of a film about juveniles incarcerated at New York's Rikers Island.\nAfterward, the law students want to know whether a label makes a difference. It's a hard question. \"Inmates?\nResidents? Scholars?\" one of them asks. \"Does it matter what you're called?\"\nCarleto studies the woman's face to discern what she wants to hear back. It is blank. He struggles. \"Not so\nmuch,\" he says, finally. He looks at her. She seems unconvinced. He worries that he has given the wrong\nanswer and tries again.\n\"Back in the community, there are certain [police] patrols in the neighborhood who say, 'I know what you're up\nto.' When we come home, some of us are trying to do right, but they basically criticize us because you're already\nlabeled.\"\n\"What are the labels?\" Forman asks.\nThis one is easy for Carleto. He sinks down in his chair and throws it out.\n\"Trouble,\" he says.\n***\nCarleto Bailey is trouble. He is also, as he rightly noted, smart. But he has arrived at Oak Hill Academy with a\nfew disadvantages: He has been poorly educated in the D.C. public schools, was frequently truant and has had\nmultiple run-ins with the law. The D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, which runs Oak Hill,\nwon't release information on the specific crime that landed Carleto here because he is still a juvenile, but we do\nknow this is Carleto's second time at the detention center. His academic knowledge is spotty at best. He can tell\nyou who James Forman is, but not where the comma falls in a letter's greeting. (\"Dear, Fidel\" he writes in a\nmock letter to Castro during English class.) He is a fairly typical Oak Hill \"scholar.\"\nAnd, once upon a time, he would have been written off But today, staff at the fledgling Oak Hill Academy are\ndetermined to view the kids' captive time here as a window of opportunity to fill in some of the gaping holes in\ntheir education. Part of the reform initiative of Vincent Schiraldi, director of Youth Rehabilitation Services, the\nschool opened its doors only last year and takes a unique approach to teaching delinquent youth.\nWhat would happen, Oak Hill Academy co-founders Forman and David Domenici wondered, if you seduced\nthese kids with content that was meaningful to them? What would happen if they had lots of good, caring\nteachers in small classrooms? What if one assumed the kids could learn -- and behaved as such? In other words,\nwhat would happen if the District's most challenged students got a private school education, albeit on a campus\nof a decidedly different nature?\n\"The bottom line,\" says Domenici, \"is that the kids most at risk need the highest quality programming, but\nthey've gotten the worst.\"\nIt is this conviction that drove Domenici, who is also the school's principal, and Forman to create three public\ncharter schools for underprivileged and troubled students in the District over the past 11 years. Called the Maya\nAngelou schools, the two high schools and middle school attack educational deficiencies from all angles.\nStudents attend small classes taught by specially trained staff. The high school day stretches from 9 a.m. to 6\np.m., with three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove too chaotic for study, are offered\nsupervised housing in the neighborhood. And it works. Last year, 93 percent of Maya Angelou graduates were\naccepted into two- or four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According to the District's Office of the State\nSuperintendent of Education, 29 percent of students who enter ninth grade in D.C. public schools and city\ncharter schools enroll in postsecondary educational programs within 18 months of graduating high school.)\nIt is a good model. But even though Domenici and Forman were used to teaching court-involved youth -- about\n40 percent of Maya Angelou students had spent some time at Oak Hill -- working inside the gates posed a new\nset of challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services has been under a court monitor for 23 years due in part to a\nhistory of abuse and poor conditions. When Schiraldi took over the department in 2005 and began his reform\nefforts by implementing a less punitive and more therapeutic detention model at Oak Hill, he saw immediately\nthat changing the school was essential. \"How could I look at my staff at Oak Hill and say we are about\nexcellence when the kids were sitting in a school that was a total waste of time from 9 to 3 every day?\"\nSchiraldi says. Kids sat and watched movies all day. Little, if any teaching was going on, Schiraldi says. \"It was\na miserable, miserable school.\"\nSchiraldi immediately began lobbying the D.C. Board of Education hard to hire someone new to operate the\nschool, and as soon as he got the okay, he put out a request for proposals. Domenici and Forman submitted a\nplan that Schiraldi says \"blew the other ones out of the water,\" and in 2007 were awarded a $12 million contract\nto run the school for the next three years.\nDomenici's and Forman's partnership is a somewhat unlikely one. Domenici is the son of former New Mexico\nRepublican senator Pete Domenici. He went to Stanford Law School, worked in corporate law for a few years\nand then gave it up to teach and work with teen delinquents. Forman is the grandson of Jessica Mitford, who\nwas the daughter of a British baron and a celebrated civil rights activist and journalist. Forman, who graduated\nfrom Yale Law School, worked as a law clerk for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and as a D.C. public defender.\nAfter seeing how few good schooling options his teenage clients had, he joined forces with Domenici, whom he\nmet through a mutual friend, to start an independent school for 20 students in 1997. A year later, it became part\nof the first Maya Angelou public charter school.\nAt Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights with an occasionally maddening bureaucracy for basics:\nfunctioning boilers, permission for a college tour for a group of six students, classes uninterrupted by\ncorrections staff who sometimes will call three-quarters of the students out in the middle of class to take their\nmeds. Forman is chairman of the Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board of Directors and board member\nof its parent group, the See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles from the other side, fundraising and\nadvocating for juvenile justice reform.\n\"When David came out to run the school here, it was like \"Ocean's 12\": Go find all the people you can trust\nfrom your previous mission,\" Forman jokes. That included past colleagues and even a few Maya Angelou\ngraduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, who had been at a then-coed Oak Hill herself when she was 15 on an\naccessory assault charge, went to a Maya Angelou school and now runs the Oak Hill Academy welcome center.\n\"I tell them, I was here, too,\" Simpore says. She tells each new student about how she was 17 years old and\ndidn't know her multiplication tables, how she rode the bus to school each day hooked up to her Walkman,\nhoping no one knew she was listening to a recitation of times tables. \"I say: 'You're at an intersection in your\nlife. You know what's down the street behind you. Nothing you can do about that. But you have a choice about\nwhat's up the road ahead.'\"\nMany of the 90 Oak Hill students, ranging in age from 14 to 19, come in performing way below grade level, and\nnearly half have been diagnosed with learning disabilities. They are at Oak Hill for an average of 10 months,\ncycling in and out on a schedule that has nothing to do with a nine-month academic year. Out of necessity, they\nare grouped according to the cell blocks they live on to keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds can be\nin classes with 18-year-olds. More than half have been committed to Oak Hill for violent felonies. Fights are\ncommon. (Before the month is out, Carleto will get into a fistfight in the hallway that will delay his release\ndate.)\nThrough the use of small classes -- typically five to 14 teens work with one teacher, a teaching assistant and a\nguard -- the school organizes the curriculum around four-week themes designed to pique students' curiosity and\nget them to think critically about the nature of democracy, social justiCe and their role in the world. For\nexample, during the Relationship theme, students parse the types of relationships ranging from those between\nhumans and the natural world (ancient river civilizations) to those between individuals and groups (Pharaohs\nand their subjects) to those between humans and ideas (liberation theology). At the same time, in English class,\nstudents will be working on the standard five-paragraph essay via the guiding question: \"Why do relationships\nmatter, and how can relationships be both good and bad for people?\" With the current unit, Change, the D.C.\npublic school system's learning standards are woven into the social studies curriculum under loose headings\nsuch as \"Changes in the Way Humans Think About the World and Their Place in It,\" which becomes a way of\nintroducing the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the Magna Carta. It's a philosophy that emphasizes\nlearning through making cross-discipline connections long popular in affluent, progressive schools but typically\neschewed in schools for underprivileged kids, where rote learning and a return to such basics often rule.\nOak Hill Academy has also created a course called Advocacy, which the Georgetown law students are co-\nteaching, emphasizing this month's theme. Domenici believes learning how the law works in a democracy \"is\nessential to teaching them to be good citizens.\"\n\"We always believed that one of our roles should be to help kids self-advocate or advocate on behalf of a\ncommunity,\" Domenici says. \"We think this is a good skill for students individually and also one that our\ndemocracy demands.\"\nBut this is an ambitious agenda, and Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can you teach teens to think\ncritically when they're missing the basic underpinnings of education? How do you teach empowerment in a\nsetting that demands rigid compliance to keep kids from misbehaving?\nAlthough he sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici does his best to buoy his staff members when they learn\nthat one of their most promising students got into a fight on the unit or \"graduated\" from the program only to\ncommit another crime and be sent back. \"I talk to staff about the fact that, day to day, our job is to do the\nabsolute best work you can in the domain that is within your control,\" he says, reminding them that they don't\ncontrol all the pieces of the puzzle. \"And if you do that well, you have done the moral and just thing.\"\nHis staff members must keep the faith while straddling what are to them two equally potent realities: First,\nknowledge is power, and through possessing it, every student is capable of success. And, absent the right\nsupport, failure lurks right around the corner. It sounds like this: \"I think Carleto has a good chance of finishing\nhigh school and going on to college,\" Domenici says. Pause. \"Also, he is highly at risk of not doing that.\"\n***\nIt is a cold day in late January, and Oak Hill is in the midst of the four-week session on change. Dressed in\njeans, a blue shirt and a gray corduroy jacket (the heat's not working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John\nAdams paces around the room and then stops to bend over Carleto, who is doodling on a piece of paper at his\ndesk.\n\"Pay attention,\" he says, taking Carleto's pencil. \"Carleto, what is today's essential question?\"\n\"What is historical change, and how is it different from other kinds of change?\" Carleto says, reading from the\nboard where Adams has scrawled his topic.\n\"Yes,\" Adams says. He ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly, until the student\nsnatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway. A youth development specialist, which is how\ncorrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi, appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back of\nthe room. But she snatches the hat from mid-air, scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket.\n\"Please sit,\" Adams tells the student.\nNot quite sitting, not quite standing, the student perches on the edge of Adams's desk.\nGood enough.\nAdams continues: \"What's the difference between personal change and historical change?\"\nSilence.\n\"Anybody?\nMore silence.\n\"Ashawntea?\"\n\"Historical change is like a revolution,\" Ashawntea says.\nAdams throws out a list of changes -- getting a raise in salary, moving to a new house, the election of President\nObama -- and Carleto accurately sorts the changes into micro and macro, personal and historical.\n\"Obama's campaign was all about change,\" Adams says. \"Do you think he is talking historical change?\" He\nwants the students to think about the president, who has been in office now for two days. What might his first\n100 days look like? he asks the students. \"What advice would you offer him?\"\nCarleto looks stumped.\n\"Just throw out some ideas,\" Adams prompts. He tells the students that they are going to craft their own letters\nto the president, advising him on how to set his agenda for change.\nCarleto slaps his pencil down on the desk. \"Obama's not reading our letters,\" he says. He folds his arms across\nhis chest, skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter -- and skeptical, perhaps, that the teachers really\nwant to hear his ideas.\n***\nLater, Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president, as he is reading Barack Obama's\n\"Dreams From My Father.\" \"It started off as a good book, but it got excellent,\" he says. He struggles hard to\narticulate the book's themes and appeal. \"I don't know how to put it,\" he says finally, \"but growing up with -- no\ndisrespect, but -- a Caucasian mom and an African father, he still made it through.\"\nSitting in a guard's room off the gym on a February evening, the echoing sound of classmates bouncing\nbasketballs around the cavernous gym, Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story.\n\"As a child, he was very fun, happy -- as far as kindergarten through sixth grade. Starting in first grade, he was\non the honor roll and was also making it to school every day,\" he says, beginning in third person, but quickly\nlapsing into first. \"In the late stages of middle school; at the end of eighth grade, I started smoking weed, doing\nstuff I wasn't supposed to be doing.\"\nHe takes full responsibility. \"No one peer-pressured me or anything. I was liking what was going on when I was\nhigh,\" he explains. He, like almost all the teens at Oak Hill, denies being involved in a gang. Still, Carleto says\nthat his best friend since elementary school was killed in 10th grade in \"a neighborhood thing.\" \"Nowadays,\nanyone can just ride up on you, and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot,\" he says, explaining that\nhis buddy was shot because of a \"miscommunication.\" \"It wasn't intended for us,\" he says, insisting that he and\nhis friend, nicknamed \"Smoke,\" were just waiting for the bus. Then he announces, \"I don't want to talk about\nit.\"\nSo he doesn't, though it clearly haunts him: He will doodle \"R.I.P. Smoke\" on the cover of his blue folder or on\na piece of loose-leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard.\nHe's happy to talk about Oak Hill Academy though, where he has a 3.5 grade-point average after six months.\n(Domenici says Carleto is in the top 25 percent of students at Oak Hill and tests fairly high on assessments.)\nCarleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him, being a senior in with freshman. He complains that\nthe classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class is\ngetting warmed up. That really bugs him, but he doesn't say much. He says that he will be leaving Oak Hill in\ntwo months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak Hill's transition center in the District, from which he says\nhe will graduate this June. When he gets out, there are a couple of things he wants to do right off, he says. First,\nhe intends to see his girlfriend, then go out to a restaurant and then go to \"the Adidas shop in Georgetown,\nwhere my mom will get me some stuff-- and my dad, too.\"\nHe says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak Hill. \"She was. . . I'm going to say she\nwas kind of like surprised at my actions, what I done,\" Carleto says. \"You know how they say 'Whatever hides\nin the dark, comes out?'. . . She was not ashamed of me, but disappointed in me.\" Meanwhile, she makes the\nlong, 45-minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit. \"Every weekend, both days!\" he says.\nHe is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life. He has four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16\nand 11 -- and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom. He says his mom works as a\nsecretary, but he struggles to remember where. \"She was working with, what's that program downtown by the\nWashington Monument, dealing with Smokey the Bear?. . . I'm trying to think. It's right by the Holocaust\nMuseum. It's a brick building. She works there.\"\nLater, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, will offer a somewhat different account of Carleto's life.\nAlthough Carleto is in 12th grade, he will not graduate in June as he says. He is still six credits shy, Jones says.\nAnd it will be at least three months -- not two -- before his release.\nCarleto's father is not part of his life, Jones says. The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming to\nOak Hill. His mother, who has a rap sheet dating to 1982, has been in and out of jail for years, arrested\nrepeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors, including possession and distribution of drugs, as well as\nprostitution. She has been in prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years for\nassault with a dangerous weapon, attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail.\nShe is not visiting Carleto on weekends.\n***\nBy the end of February, still in the midst of the unit on change, the Oak Hill teens file into their advocacy class,\njostling each other, edgy. It is unseasonably warm outside, and they do not want to be here. Reluctantly they\ntake their seats, and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prison\nyard, visible through the door someone has wedged open. Occasionally, a breeze wafts into the room.\nToday, the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement. If youths of color\nare 35 percent of the general population in the United States, but 62 percent of the prison population, this is\ndisproportionate minority confinement, the law students explain. They refer the teens to a handout each has on\nthe desk in front of him, an article excerpt from New American Media, \"Racism of the Juvenile Justice System\nRevealed,\" to explain that this isn't simply because people of color commit more crimes: \"African-American\nyouths are 4.5 times more likely, and Latinos 2.3 times more likely, than white youths to be detained for\nidentical offenses. About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formally\ncharged and drawn into the system. Only one-quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similar\nbreak.\"\nAlthough youth of color are 100 percent of Oak Hill's population of inmates and, indeed, 100 percent of all 721\njuvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth Rehabilitation Services care in settings across the city,\ndisproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee\ntries a pie graph, a bar graph, a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os. Blank stares.\nThen it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what they're talking about. \"Hey,\" he says, suddenly sitting forward.\n\"They're switched around! Basically, there's more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles -- even though\nthere's more of them.\"\n\"Yes,\" Fee says. \"So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system.\"\nAshavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over.\nFee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasons\nbehind these figures. They have prepared a role-playing game to coax the teens into thinking about this from\ndifferent perspectives. Then, they want the students to practice advocating for change. \"So, we're going to have\nthree roles,\" Fee says, dividing the teens into pairs. \"One group is a 15-year-old; one group is playing a math\nteacher; and one group is playing a city council member.\"\nCarleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation on\nreforming the police department. Carleto doesn't want to be a city council member. He doesn't even want to be\nhere today. He wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T-shirt. He puts his glasses on, then takes\nthem off.\n\"How could you maintain better relationships\" with police? Fee asks, settling herself into a chair to help Carleto\nand his partner work through this.\nCarleto throws his pencil down on the table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, he offers a sullen\nchallenge. \"Stop harassing people for no reason?\"\n\"How do you want them to treat people?\"\n\"Equally,\" he says. He picks up the pencil and tap, tat, taps it on the desk. Fee tries to get him to be more\nspecific.\n\"Don't arrest for small problems. Instead, take them home, and tell your family what you're doing,\" Carleto's\npartner says, unconsciously slipping into second person.\n\"And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general?\" Fee prods.\nA long pause. Could be their minds are whirring busily; could be they're spacing out. Fee, a teacher before\nenrolling at Georgetown, takes it in stride. She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question.\n\"Don't have 10 or 15 cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car,\" Carleto says.\n\"Patrol each ward equally?\" asks Fee.\nCarleto writes that down, then adds: \"I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain't right.\" Fee nods, encourages\nhim to write it down.\nCarleto's partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes. \"The majority of police shouldn't carry guns. I could\nsay, 'The majority of police are racist.'\"\n\"But how would you fix that?\" Fee. prods.\n\"A camera on their car to catch them if they're doing it -- but a secret one,\" Carleto suggests. He sits up\nstraighter in his chair. \"And don't just pull over people because they're black. They can say anything, that's the\nreason why I pulled you over, because your headlights are off or whatever.\" Suddenly, Carleto is on a roll, and\nhe rattles off a list of improvements.\n\"Call to order of the city council,\" says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi.\nCarleto and his partner stand in the front of the class. \"Hello, I'm Mr. Jones, and I am a city councilman,\"\nCarleto says, glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand. \"We have some\ncomplaints from the different communities and wards about police, and these are some of our suggestions about\ncracking down on officers.\" He sounds nervous as he begins the list. \"Stop harassing minorities and other ethnic\nyouths, and treat them equal to the same race that you are. Also, police don't arrest if there is a situation at the\nschool like a fight or anything. I feel they should not be arrested but taken home. Then tell their parents why\nthis happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police.\" He moves briskly through the\nsuggestions and twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact with the audience. In conclusion, he says,\n\"verbally abusing\" youth won't be tolerated any more. \"Basically, we want to crack down on the officers and\nhave them removed, if so.\"\nAnother pair of students rises to begin a presentation, but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard's\nwalkie-talkie. \"Time to go!\" the guard announces.\nThe law students are surprised -- they are not quite done -- but politely acquiesce.\n\"Wait!\" Ashawntea says, standing up. \"We got 10 more minutes.\"\n\"It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on,\" the guard says.\n\"But we have 10 minutes!\" Carleto insists. He and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms. \"It's only 2:20.\nWe got 10 more minutes still.\"\nThe guard takes a beat, then shrugs and concedes Carleto's point. He goes back out into the hall to wait.\nCarleto shoots Ashawntea a look of surprise. His advocacy worked.\n\"Yesss!\" Ashawntea hisses under his breath.\nKaren Houppert is a contributing writer for the Magazine.

The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and\nRepublican Senate negotiators on a health care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance\nCommittee considered the so-called individual mandate essential to lower insurance costs for\nthose who already have coverage.\nPresident Barack Obama didn't embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, which\nmeans he would essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters.\nThe mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton, who argued that a mandate\nwas the only way to achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people would\npurchase insurance voluntarily if the costs could be brought down.\nProgressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama's plan would have left out about 15 million\npeople. Clinton, with an assist from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, regularly\nassailed Obama for his no-mandate position.\nActually, I don't care who gets credit, as long as we actually get universal health care.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Paul Krugman", "type": "person"}, {"id": "blog", "type": "website"}, {"id": "May 19, 2009", "type": "date"}, {"id": "7:35 am", "type": "time"}, {"id": "Politico", "type": "website"}, {"id": "Health care", "type": "policy"}, {"id": "automobile", "type": "policy"}, {"id": "insurance coverage", "type": "policy"}, {"id": "American", "type": "nationality"}, {"id": "tax penalties", "type": "policy"}, {"id": "Democratic", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Republican", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Senate", "type": "governmental_body"}, {"id": "Finance Committee", "type": "governmental_body"}, {"id": "individual mandate", "type": "policy"}, {"id": "insurance costs", "type": "policy"}, {"id": "Barack Obama", "type": "person"}, {"id": "campaign", "type": "event"}, {"id": "voters", "type": "person"}, {"id": "policy experts", "type": "profession"}, {"id": "New York Times", "type": "newspaper"}, {"id": "universal coverage", "type": "policy"}, {"id": "Progressive", "type": "political_movement"}, {"id": "15 million people", "type": "population"}], "edges": [{"source": "Paul Krugman", "target": "blog", "label": "author"}, {"source": "blog", "target": "May 19, 2009", "label": "publish_date"}, {"source": "May 19, 2009", "target": "7:35 am", "label": "publish_time"}, {"source": "Politico", "target": "Health care", "label": "report_on"}, {"source": "Health care", "target": "automobile", "label": "comparison"}, {"source": "Health care", "target": "insurance coverage", "label": "requirement"}, {"source": "American", "target": "insurance coverage", "label": "requirement"}, {"source": "insurance coverage", "target": "tax penalties", "label": "consequence"}, {"source": "Senate", "target": "Finance Committee", "label": "membership"}, {"source": "Finance Committee", "target": "individual mandate", "label": "consideration"}, {"source": "individual mandate", "target": "insurance costs", "label": "impact_on"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "campaign", "label": "participate_in"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "voters", "label": "appeal_to"}, {"source": "policy experts", "target": "universal coverage", "label": "opinion_on"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "universal coverage", "label": "oppose"}, {"source": "Hillary Clinton", "target": "universal coverage", "label": "support"}, {"source": "Hillary Clinton", "target": "Paul Krugman", "label": "collaborate_with"}, {"source": "Hillary Clinton", "target": "Barack Obama", "label": "disagree_with"}, {"source": "Hillary Clinton", "target": "15 million people", "label": "impact_on"}, {"source": "New York Times", "target": "Paul Krugman", "label": "support"}]}, "From": "Tanden, Neera", "Date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2009 6:51 PM"}, {"id": "C05761409", "title": "SIX UIGHURS", "prompt": "Have they landed yet?

In the Obama\nAdministration, we will use smart power to advance to our shared security, shared prosperity and shared humanity.\nIn advancing our shared security, we seek to:\n\u2022 Reduce threat of violent extremism\n\u2022 Reduce the spread of weapons of mass destruction\nIn advancing our shared prosperity, we seek to:\n\u2022 Use development to create and sustain strong stable economies by:\no Focusing on women as essential for driving economic growth;\no Expanding access to food and the means to grow or buy it; and,\no Expanding access to quality education in developing countries;\n\u2022 Expand access to stable, affordable and increasingly clean energy sources\nIn advancing our shared humanity, we seek to:\n\u2022 Expand human rights and the conditions that promote respect for human rights\n\u2022 Support the development of health systems that support healthier societies and\nconfront the spread of pandemic disease (e.g., AlDs)\nHow we achieve these goals:\nWe will advance these goals through shared responsibility and the application of smart power. America has the\nresponsibility to lead, but can only lead in partnership with others. Smart power means elevating and\nintegrating diplomacy and development.\nDIPLOMACY:\nFocus on priority partnerships:\n\u2022 Revitalized partnerships with historic allies EU, Japan, Korea, Australia;\n\u2022 Calibrated partnerships with China and Russia;\n31\n\u2022 Cultivated partnerships: Brazil, India, Turkey, Indonesia, and South Africa;\n\u2022 Targeted public/private and multilateral partnerships based upon the principles of\nvariable geometry (Le., focused on the problem at hand).\nBuild strong partnerships by:\n\u2022 listening and mutual respect \u2014 which has begun already and will continue\n\u2022 being accountable for the challenges we create and demanding that our partners are\nsimilarly accountable;\n\u2022 focusing on government to people, and people to people connections using new\ntechnology to create buy in from bottom up so shared responsibility is experienced\non the ground and sustainable;\n\u2022 eliminating the obstacles to cooperation that stand in the way of us achieve our\ngoals (e.g., resolving Cyprus so Turkey can enter the EU; engaging Iran to create\ngreater accountability among EU partners if engagement fails)\n\u2022 creating work plans to drive cooperation on our shared agenda: tasks, timetables\nand benchmarks for each country\nDEVELOPMENT:\nEstablish and implement against our critical priorities:\n\u2022 Women as economic drivers and social stabilizers;\n\u2022 Education as the gateway to economic opportunity and human rights;\n\u2022 Food and agriculture as the cornerstone of sustainable local economies\n\u2022 Global health as the foundation for the future\nReform our government institutions\n\u2022 Improve coordination in planning and budgeting across our diplomacy and\ndevelopment\n\u2022 Make Ambassadors country-level CEOs responsible for government-wide\nefforts in each country.\no Grow the quality, talents and capacities of our development institutions;\no Introduce effective metrics and evaluation for accountability\nImprove delivery and outcomes\n32\n\u2022 Assess and promote what works and stop spending resources on what doesn't.\n\u2022 Establish

He has a remarkable\nstory: born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and\ndeveloped strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which\ndevastates crops across Africa.\nOutside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify,\nand market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And\nhe has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists.\nA COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE\nDr. Ejeta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it\u2014one\nthat connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor\nto feed their families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where\npeople get the nourishment they need to thrive.\nIn many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will\ngo to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and\nstudents to learn, which in turn stunts economic development. Last year's food riots demonstrated that when\nfood is scarce, political stability is threatened.\n44\nTo date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it\nis a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.\nThe Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the\ncreation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural\nproductivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources.\nWe will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual\nstrategies that meet their needs\u2014for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development\nPlan. To facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments,\nmultilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals.\nTHE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH\nWe've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach.\n\u2022 Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to\npurchase them, and the training to use them.\n\u2022 Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving\ntransportation to connect small farmers to markets.\n\u2022 Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right\nadaptations for the changing environment.\n\u2022 Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture\nscientists.\n\u2022 Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide.\n\u2022 Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear and\npredictable policy and regulatory environment.\n\u2022 Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are women, but\nmost of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for\nagriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities' future.\nA PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME\nIn the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to\nglobal coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who\nhave been working so long in this arena\u2014from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the\nprivate sector. The President's conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our\napproach, as well as my trip to Africa in August.\nAddressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expanding\nopportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why supporting sustainable agriculture\nworldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration.\nCONCLUSION\nYou can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close.

These will guide our\napproach.\n\u2022 Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer,\nirrigation, the credit to purchase them, and the training to use them.\n\u2022 Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and\nimproving transportation to connect small farmers to markets.\n\u2022 Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can\nmake the right adaptations for the changing environment.\n\u2022 Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of\nagriculture scientists.\n\u2022 Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and\nwide.\n\u2022 Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in\na clear and predictable policy and regulatory environment.\n\u2022 Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are\nwomen, but most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men.\nThis must change for agriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to\ncontribute to their communities' future.\nA PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME\nIn the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our\napproach to global coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom\nand guidance of those who have been working so long in this arena\u2014from the Congress to\nNGOs to academics to foundations to the private sector. The President's conversations at the G-\n8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our approach, as well as my trip to Africa in August.\nAddressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies,\nand expanding opportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why\nsupporting sustainable agriculture worldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the\nObama Administration.\nCONCLUSION\nYou can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close. He represents the need for a multinational\napproach: born in Ethiopia, educated in the United States, advised by Indian scientists, advisor\nto several African nations.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id":

Jeff\nJune 20, 2009\nThe Myth of the $12 Million Uighur\n. By STUART BECK\nCONGRATULATIONS Palau. Our little country, a group of islands 500 miles east of the Philippines, has become, if only\nbriefly, a household word. President Obama, much admired in Palau, asked our new president, Johnson Toribiong, to do\nthe United States a favor: Please accept, as refugees, a group of innocent Chinese Muslims. They are not anti-American\nterrorists, but victims of human rights violations, who landed at Guantanamo Bay for seven years. Innocent, stateless,\nharmless.\nPresident Toribiong, a lawyer trained at the University of Washington and a highly regarded litigator, told President\nObama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that he needed to assure his people that the Uighurs were indeed harmless,\nand could be integrated into Palau's small, diverse and friendly culture. Assuming that this due diligence brought\nsatisfactory results, Palau would be pleased to give the refugees temporary residence. Last weekend, he dispatched a\nnumber of officials to Guantanamo to interview the Uighurs and review their records.\nOne would have thought that this positive gesture of friendship from a staunch American ally would have been applauded,\nat least in the United States. Instead, for reasons that are beyond me, unattributed leaks and unsubstantiated rumors have\ntwisted Palau's act of decency into another grab for dollars by a cunning third-world country. In breaking the story that\nPalau was amenable to President Obama's request, the Associated Press reported that two anonymous State Department\nofficials had linked Palau's acceptance of the Uighurs to a $200 million payoff.\nAlmost immediately, much of the news media took the bait, did the math and asserted that Palau was getting nearly $12\nmillion dollars per Uighur. Within a day or two, The Wall Street Journal was pontificating against a shakedown.\nBefore the story gets too far out of hand, let's consider a few facts. It is true that the United States and Palau have an\neconomic relationship. Palau has been receiving American aid since it was wrested from the Japanese in 1944. (Over the\npast 15 years, this has averaged about $56 million a year.) This aid has come with strings; as the United States has always\ninsisted that the Palauan government be ready to promptly turn over land for bases should the security of the United\nStates or Palau require it.\nB6\nIn 1994, the two countries agreed to a 50-year option that allows the United States to use Palau for military purposes. That\nagreement's economic terms expire in October 2009, and a new economic package for the remaining 35 years is in the\nworks \u2014 and has been for some time. But there has never been a mention of $200 million. And no one has even hinted at\nlinking the deal to Palau's acceptance of the Uighurs. The United States simply offered to pay relocation costs for the\nUighurs of less than $90,000 per person to cover transportation, food, housing and medical help until the men can get\noriented and get jobs.\nPalau is a small and peaceful community. Its constitution bans weapons of all kinds. Capital crimes are virtually unknown.\nSocial life revolves around the family. Children wander from house to house. Could anyone believe that the leaders of\nPalau would risk the safety and serenity of their modern Eden in exchange for money? Is it plausible that these close-knit\npeople would countenance the presence of terrorists in their midst? I can assure you the answer is no.\nLast week, the Palauans lowered their flags to half-staff in memory of Sgt. Jasper Obakrairur, a Palauan who joined the\nUnited States Marines and died on June 1 helping to root out the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was the fourth Palauan\nserviceman to die in recent years, following his fallen comrades in American uniform Cpl. JayGee Meluat, Cpl.\nMeresebang Ngiraked and Specialist Philton Ueld. The people of Palau are very proud of them, and of our country's special\nrelationship with the United States. Can't Americans be proud of the relationship, too?\nStuart Beck is Palau's permanent representative to the United Nations.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Palau", "type": "country"}, {"id": "UN Amb.

He has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran, 1,500 people,\nexperts with extensive contacts, and many Iranians, deeply embedded in the unfolding events\nGary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild-mannered\nreformer to directly challenging the regime. Nobody, he says, knows where this will go, certainly not\nthe Iranians. Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification, plunging into the arena\nas a political player. Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto, just translated; I enclose\nbelow Sick's report and analysis on it. This poses, Sick says, a new challenge to Khamenei. Does he\nlet it stand? Does he answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can't accomplish anything with\nthe regime until the crisis completely works its way out, which could take years. He points out that the\nfirst mass demonstrations against the Shah occurred a full year before his overthrow. He adds that\nthe one thing the regime has learned fro m the Shah is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations.\nTwo ideas, who knows, but here they are: 1. Though the regime uses Western protests to consolidate\ncontrol, some of them contribute to its deep crisis of legitimacy. Sick says Obama's statement, for\nexample, was good. He also cites a statement from Ban Ki Moon. If there would be a UN action,\nshouldn't it focus ont he human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging the\nregime to stop illegitimate violence of paramilitary militias? US shouldn't initiate. 2. Establish linkage\nin negotiations with Russians on Start between their objections to missile defense outposts in Poland\nand Czech Republic (especially if we plan to give them up) with Russian arms sales to Iran.\nGet well. See Sick analysis below.\nSid\n5ousavi's New Revolutionary Manifesto\nby Gary Sick\nJune 21, 2009 I 10:51am\n\u2014\nL Alfred, Sipa / AP Photo The Iranian protest movement reached a tipping point today, writes Gary Sick,\n\u2022\nthe key White House offical during the 1979 hostage crisis, and what has emerged is nothing short of a platform for\na true Islamic democracy.\nPlus, read more insight on Iran's election from other Daily Beast writers.\nToday, Mir Hossein Mousavi, the presidential candidate who has come to represent the democratic aspirations\nof the Iranian people, issued a formal statement.\nAlthough he denounces the \"lies and fraud\" of the leadership, particularly in the recent election, he views the\nfraudulent election as only as the symptom of something far more serious. He describes a revolution gone\nwrong, a revolution that was originally based on attention to the voice of the peo ple but has resulted in \"forcing\nan unwanted government on the nation.\"\nIt is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement\u2014and Mousavi himself\u2014have evolved enormously\nin the past week.\nThis moment is \"a turning point,\" he says, and he defines the movement that is forming around him as having a\n\"historical mission\" to accomplish nothing less than \"renewing the life of the nation\" according to its own\nideals.\nHe acknowledges, interestingly, that his own voice at the beginning was less \"eloquent\" than he would have\nwished and that the people were ahead of him in turning the movement green. But now he accepts the \"burden\nof duty put on our shoulders by the destiny of generations and ages.\"\nHe denounces both extremes of the political spectrum: on one hand those who believe that \"Islamic government\nis the same as Tyranny of the Rightful;\" and on the other, those who \"consider religion and Islam to be blockers\nfor realization of republicanism,\" i.e. those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam.\nMousavi says his call for annulment of the election and a revote, supervised by an impartial national body, \"is a\ngiven right.\" The objective is nothing less than \"to achieve a new type of political life in the country.\"\nThat is truly a revolutionary statement. He says he will stand by the side of all those seeking \"new solutions\" in\na n on-violent way. He accepts the principles and the institutions of the Islamic Republic, including the\nRevolutionary Guard and the basij, but denounces \"deviations and deceptions.\" He demands reform \"that\nreturns us to the pure principles of the Islamic Revolution.\"\nHe calls for freedom of expression in all its forms, and says that if the government permits people to express\ntheir views freely, \"there won't be a need for the presence of military and regulatory forces in the streets.\"\nIt is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement\u2014and Mousavi himself\u2014have evolved enormously\nin the past week. The candidate started as a mild-mannered reformer. After the searing events of the past several\ndays, he has dared to preach a counter sermon to Khamene'i's lecture on Islamic government. Although he never\nmentions the Leader by name, there is no overlooking the direct contradiction of his arguments. This open\nopposition to the Leader by a political figure is unprecedented. \u2022\nMousavi has in fact issued a manifesto for a new vision of the Islamic Republic. The repression and disdain of\nthe government has brought the opposition to a place they probably never dreamed of going. And no one knows\nwhere any of the parties are likely to go next.\nBut for outside observers, it is like standing on the edge of a glacier and feeling the ice begin to crack under\nyour feet.\nGary Sick served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan.

I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in the\nregion from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key findings from the report, but the\nmain takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technical\nanalysis of China's capabilities would suggest, and for a range of reasons, technical and political, prospects for regional\ncooperation are limited, but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing.\nAll best, Jackie\nKey findings from the workshop include:\n\u2022 Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than\nforecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within 1,000\nkilometers of the Chinese coastline.\n\u2022 The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of\nSSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, and possibly Pakistan.\n\u2022 Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area\nhave continued to develop, with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka, to complement the existing\nrelations with Myanmar and Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of \"blue-brown water\" naval operations, in which\nChinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases, but close to the coasts of client states.\nThe workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperation\neasy. These trends\ninclude:\nJapanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1,000\nmiles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan's maritime autonomy.\n\u2022 Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan Island,\nChinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar, and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missile\nsubmarines operating close to India.\n\u2022 Indian interest in SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports in Hainan and\neven, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean, along\nwith the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea.\n\u2022 Asymmetries in levels of operational competence, and technology, in\nsubmarines and maritime aviation, which, for example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder for\nstates that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses.\n\u2022 The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes in\nthis region, which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in\nhomeland areas.\nThe report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region.\nThe first scenario, which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both, compels us to consider:\n\u2022 The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstrate\nthat their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected, and\n\u2022 What the United States would lose if it did not support the\nJapanese, and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state,\ncapable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States.\nThe second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon, potentially\ngiving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close to\nterritory of a client of China, a \"blue-brown water\" clash. In this scenario, China is using its navy to show presence, and\nto force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less than\nblack and white. Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstances\nunderscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a narrow assessment of their\nmilitary capabilities would suggest.\nOn Fri, May 22, 2009 at 7:45 AM, <newmyer wrote:\n> Secretary Clinton, The Australian is the newspaper in which I read\n> your remarks on Asia-Pacific.

After a grueling seven-nation, 11-day trip, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\nwrapped up her Africa tour on Friday by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent.\n\"I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed,\" Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde.\n\"I have seen the joy and energy Africans have, evidenced not just by the boogieing, but by the hard work and\nperseverance,\" she said, referring to a recent comment from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that she knew\nhow to \"boogie\" with African dancers.\n\"And we've seen the worst humanity can do to itself,\" she added, presumably referring to Congo, where Mrs. Clinton\nmet victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end.\nMrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucial\nallies on the continent, like Nigeria and South Africa, and sending a message of \"tough love,\" as she called it, to nations\nlike Kenya and Congo.\nOver all, she said, the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner, not simply as a patron\nor dispenser of aid. In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.\nMrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she\naddressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and\nenormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.\n\"This is possible,\" she said. \"You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.\"\nKenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of\nAfrica's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to\nprosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the\nSouth African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.\nIn Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many\ninroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was\npassionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.\n\"The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for\nthat conflict,\" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. \"Her commitment to\naddressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the\nusual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.\"\n\"Now,\" he added, \"comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations\nengendered by her visit.\"\nIn Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson\nSirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.\nThe Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th\ncentury by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-\nbrimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant\nwelcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud\nfunny noises whenever she said something striking.\n\"I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,\" she said.\nIn Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country\nthat included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the\nturmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa.

And the reaction I have heard today has been very\npositive.\nLet raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as\nI understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There are\ntwo ways:\n1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a\nhandful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would\nrepresent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it\nwould trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about\nour effectiveness.\n2. The alternative would be for the administration to say:\na. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a\nsettlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.\nb. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of\nhousing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we\nhave expressed to them..\n\u2022c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants\nan immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help\npromote a two-state solution.\nThis latter option retains our credibility, does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to move\nforward.\nOf course, I am around if you want to discuss.\nGood luck in India.

The fourth is the key\nparagraph. Jake, I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 o,\nA Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau, islands which the U.S. took in war and\nsubsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact, which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 1,\n1994, includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years, including full U.S. military authority --\nalthough the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is to\ncontinue in perpetuity.\nThe amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15\nyears, but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th, 30th, and\n40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands'\ndevelopment. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economic\ndevelopment.\nA Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua\nKoshiba, Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassador\nto the U.S. Hersey Kyota, Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in Honolulu on July\n8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office\nof Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives of\nthe Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.\nThe U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number of\nthe U.S. delegation's statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as well\nas the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibility\ncommitments, and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in the\nU.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture, and Palau's positions in\nthe U.N.\nPalau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact,\ndeepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positive\nexpressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political\nparties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to\npositions befitting the great nation that is the United States.\nRecognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and that\nthe U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time, Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officials\ncan be needed.\nBecause of this, because of the confidence that it has in the United States, and because it would not be productive to\nelaborate with others on the conversations at this stage, Palau's representatives are confining additional comment to\nofficial communications.\nB6", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Palau", "type": "country"}, {"id": "United States", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Compact of Free Association", "type": "treaty"}, {"id": "U.S. military authority", "type": "authority"}, {"id": "U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance", "type": "assistance"}, {"id": "15th Anniversary Review", "type": "review"}, {"id": "Palauan delegation", "type": "delegation"}, {"id": "Vice President Kerai Mariur", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua Koshiba", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J.

KWANG-TAE KIM\nAssociated Press\nSat Jul 25, 4:51 am ET\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea has indicated its interest in holding direct talks with the United States, a news report\nsaid, after the two sides traded barbs over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs at a security forum. \"We are not\nagainst a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern,\" Japan's Kyodo news agency\nquoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in\nNew York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan,\nChina and Russia, saying \"the six-party talks are gone forever.\" The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within\nthe six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last\nweekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North\nKorea and the U.S. were slim. \"Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective\napproach\" to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks \"cheated\"\nNorth Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more\ndetails were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the\nU.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket\nlaunch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range\nmissile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing\ninternational condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea's\nnuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. \"North Korea will\nbe a significant topic, but obviously one among many,\" State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in\nWashington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of State\nHillary Rodham Clinton's recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to \"small children\" demanding attention. At\na regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North \"has no friends left.\" North Korea's Foreign\nMinistry described her Thursday as \"a funny lady\" who sometimes \"looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a\npensioner going shopping.\"\n298", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "North Korea", "type": "country"}, {"id": "United States", "type": "country"}, {"id": "direct

SID", "prompt": "Hillary: FYI: I found this one of the most sensible and informed brief articles on Afghanistan. Patrick Cockburn, of\nthe London Independent, is one of the best informed on-the-ground journalists. He was almost always correct on\nIraq. Sid\nPatrick Cockburn: To say this war must be won\nin a year is nonsense\nhttp://www.independent co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockbum-to-say-this-war-must-be-won-\nin-a-year-is-nonsense-1799296.html\nThursday, 8 October 2009\nSPONSORED LINKS:\nEight years ago I was standing on a hill 50 miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night sky\nas the US air strikes started again st the Taliban front line. There were a few ineffective puffs of fire\nfrom Taliban anti-aircraft guns which could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining down\non them.\nIt was a strange war to cover, not least because so little real fighting took place. The reputation of the\nAfghan fighting man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment. In the\nmeantime they don't fight too hard for anybody and try to avoid getting killed.\nThe US and British press mostly reported the war of 2001 as a real military conflict and rather missed\nthe point that the Taliban had just gone home. I remember visiting the former headquarters of a\nTaliban armoured brigade in the city of Ghazni south west of Kabul. The tanks and armoured vehicles\nhad all been smashed to pieces by American bombs, but when I asked local people how many men\nthe Taliban had lost, I was told \"none at all. They could see what was going to happen so they just\nran away.\"\nJust as the US military victory of 2001 was overstated, so eight years later is the sense of military\ncrisis which is being busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal, the top US and NATO commander\nin Afghanistan. In Washington military officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost in\nthe next twelve months.\nThis is nonsense. The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years because\nthey have Pakistani backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness of\nPresident Hamid Karzai's government. But the Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtun\ncommunity, which makes up 42 per cent of the Afghan population. They will have great difficulty\nadvancing into areas occupied by the other 58 per cent of the population where there is a Tajik,\nHazara or Uzbek majority.\nSquads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul, but there\nis no need to treat them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in 1975.\nThe strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory, but that they can inflict\nquite small military losses on the US which are politically unacceptable back home. They can do this\nthrough roadside bombs, something the US army speaks as i f it were a new device, though it was\nbeing used against the British army in Ireland in 1921. If the Americans and British try to hold territory\nsupposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are vulnerable to being\nsuddenly targeted by the other side.\nIt is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra 40,000 soldiers. But\nAfghans tell me that more foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as more\nof the country becomes a battlefield. It is absurd to imagine that the world's most heavily equipped\nmilitary force is not going to use its weapons when it comes under attack. Polls also show that\nTaliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been killed by\nAmerican shells and bombs.\nSo what should Obama do? First of all he has time. He is not going to win or lose the war in the next\nyear. Like it or not he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea. It is reasonable to\nsuggest helping to produce a larger Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight.\nMost military recruits are there for the money and are too malnourished even to wear American flack\njackets. Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the summer that terrified men,\noften on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three weeks\ntraining. Many of them did not come back.\nOne way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid\nproperly. In Kabul many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is not\nenough to live on unless supplemented with bribes. This contrasts with $250,000 a year paid to\nforeign consultants who lurk inside heavily defended compounds. Paying the Iraqi army properly\nreally did make a difference in Baghdad and might do the same in Afghanistan where 40 per cent of\nmen are unemployed. A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion while the\nAfghan government is dependent on foreign aid.\nThe US and its allies will have to pay. It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama should\nbe considering and not the panicky dispatch of US Special Forces or tens of thousand of more troops.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Patrick Cockburn", "type": "journalist"}, {"id": "London Independent", "type": "media_outlet"}, {"id": "Afghanistan", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Iraq", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Taliban", "type": "militant_group"}, {"id": "Ghazni", "type": "city"}, {"id": "US", "type": "country"}, {"id": "British", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Washington", "type": "city"}, {"id": "NATO", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Gen Stanley A McChrystal", "type": "military_commander"}, {"id": "Hamid Karzai", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "Pashtun", "type": "ethnic_group"}, {"id": "Tajik", "type": "ethnic_group"}, {"id": "Hazara", "type": "ethnic_group"}, {"id": "Uzbek", "type": "ethnic_group"}, {"id": "Kabul", "type": "city"}, {"id": "North Vietnamese", "type": "militant_group"}, {"id": "Saigon", "type": "city"}, {"id": "Ireland", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Obama", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "American", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Baghdad", "type": "city"}, {"id": "foreign consultants", "type": "profession"}, {"id": "Iraqi army", "type": "military"}, {"id": "foreign aid", "type": "financial_support"}, {"id": "US Special Forces", "type": "military"}, {"id": "tens of thousand of more troops", "type": "military"}], "edges": [{"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "London Independent", "label": "works_for"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Afghanistan", "label": "reporting_location"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Iraq", "label": "reporting_location"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Taliban", "label": "reporting_on"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Ghazni", "label": "visited"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "US", "label": "reporting_location"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "British", "label": "reporting_location"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Washington", "label": "visited"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "NATO", "label": "reporting_on"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Gen Stanley A McChrystal", "label": "criticizing"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Hamid Karzai", "label": "criticizing"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Pashtun", "label": "reporting_on"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Tajik", "label": "reporting_on"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Hazara", "label": "reporting_on"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Uzbek", "label": "reporting_on"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Kabul", "label": "reporting_location"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "North Vietnamese", "label": "comparison"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Saigon", "label": "reporting_location"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Ireland", "label": "reporting_location"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Obama", "label": "advising"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "American", "label": "reporting_location"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Baghdad", "label": "reporting_location"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "foreign consultants", "label": "comparison"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "Iraqi army", "label": "comparison"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "foreign aid", "label": "dependency_on"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "US Special Forces", "label": "criticizing"}, {"source": "Patrick Cockburn", "target": "tens of thousand of more troops", "label": "criticizing"}]}, "From": "sbwhoeop", "Date": "Thursday, October 8, 2009 10:14 AM"}, {"id": "C05764323", "title": "STEINMEIR CONFIRMED FOR 4PM.", "prompt": "1/7", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "1/7", "type": "date"}], "edges": []}, "From": "Abedin, Huma", "Date": "Saturday, August 22, 2009 12:46 PM"}, {"id": "C05764338", "title": "MARA", "prompt": "Just spoke with her \u2014 says things are pretty grim.

There's no real\ncompetition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies.\" And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of the\nbill. His political assessment was even harsher: \"It's effectively dead,\" he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucus\nplan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyone\ngives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more\nfor his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as\nWeiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to\nnonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean\ninto the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest\nand savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever bill\neventually lands on Barack Obama's desk\u2014and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care\npaper will wind up there\u2014won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has\nbeen more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have\na long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer prot\u00e9g\u00e9\nand we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious,\nwicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in\nother words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a\nmatter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. \"This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother ship\nthat was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment,\" he says. \"You didn't have the president out there\nspeaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfort\nwith the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback\" Weiner laughs. \"Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town-\nhall meeting, someone on my staff said, 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.\u2014 Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum\nthat he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and\ndeath of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of\nwhat would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist;\nhe is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillary's longtime personal aide. \"It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and this\nhas become my issue,\" Weiner says. \"If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening.\" Weiner allows that\nhe's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the\ncleverness and chutzpa he's displayed\u2014especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an\nequation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a\n\"government takeover\" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White House\npursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and\n1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approving\u2014a point he's made abundantly and consistently\nclear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that \"up to\nnow, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple\nof hours.\" And he's apparently had no change of heart. \"The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large,\" he tells\nme.\nSuch criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner\u2014in a testament to his\nconsistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three\u2014hasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to\nWashington from New York on Air Force One, I'm told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testy", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Magazine", "type": "publication"}, {"id": "The Power Grid", "type": "article_title"}, {"id": "Death Panel", "type": "issue"}, {"id": "public option", "type": "healthcare_policy"}, {"id": "congressman", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "White House", "type": "government_building"}, {"id": "Oct 11, 2009", "type": "publication_date"}, {"id": "Washington", "type": "city"}, {"id": "Baucus health-care bill", "type": "legislation"}, {"id": "Congressional Budget Office", "type": "government_agency"}, {"id": "Anthony Weiner", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "Rayburn Building", "type": "government_building"}, {"id": "legislation", "type": "law"}, {"id": "cost savings", "type": "financial_term"}, {"id": "competition", "type": "business_term"}, {"id": "insurance companies", "type": "business_entities"}, {"id": "Senate Finance Committee", "type": "government_committee"}, {"id": "Mike Bloomberg", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "Barack Obama", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "health-care paper", "type": "document"}, {"id": "Chuck Schumer", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "Capitol Hill", "type": "government_building"}, {"id": "Medicare reimbursement rates", "type": "healthcare_policy"}, {"id": "Hillary Clinton", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "Foggy Bottom", "type": "neighborhood"}, {"id": "Huma Abedin", "type": "political_aide"}, {"id": "Madame Secretary", "type": "title"}, {"id": "Obama White House", "type": "government_building"}, {"id": "joint session of Congress", "type": "government_meeting"}, {"id": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue", "type": "government_building"}, {"id": "New York", "type": "city"}, {"id": "Air Force One", "type": "aircraft"}], "edges": [{"source": "Magazine", "target": "The Power Grid", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "The Power Grid", "target": "Death Panel", "label": "main_topic"}, {"source": "Death Panel", "target": "public option", "label": "related_to"}, {"source": "congressman", "target": "White House", "label": "related_to"}, {"source": "Oct 11, 2009", "target": "Magazine", "label": "published_in"}, {"source": "Washington", "target": "Baucus health-care bill", "label": "location_of"}, {"source": "Congressional Budget Office", "target": "Baucus health-care bill", "label": "approved_by"}, {"source": "Anthony Weiner", "target": "Rayburn Building", "label": "located_in"}, {"source": "legislation", "target": "cost savings", "label": "lacks"}, {"source": "legislation", "target": "competition", "label": "lacks"}, {"source": "legislation", "target": "insurance companies", "label": "favors"}, {"source": "Senate Finance Committee", "target": "Anthony Weiner", "label": "criticized_by"}, {"source": "Mike Bloomberg", "target": "Anthony Weiner", "label": "challenged_by"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "health-care paper", "label": "receives"}, {"source": "Chuck Schumer", "target": "Anthony Weiner", "label": "mentored_by"}, {"source": "Capitol Hill", "target": "Anthony Weiner", "label": "located_in"}, {"source": "Medicare reimbursement rates", "target": "Anthony Weiner", "label": "advocates_for"}, {"source": "Hillary Clinton", "target": "Foggy Bottom", "label": "moved_to"}, {"source": "Huma Abedin", "target": "Hillary Clinton", "label": "aide_to"}, {"source": "Madame Secretary", "target": "Hillary Clinton", "label": "title_of"}, {"source": "Obama White House", "target": "Weiner", "label": "criticized_by"}, {"source": "joint session of Congress", "target": "Obama White House", "label": "addressed_by"}, {"source": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue", "target": "Weiner", "label": "criticized_by"}, {"source": "New York", "target": "Air Force One", "label": "flight_origin"}]}, "From": "Abedin, Huma", "Date": "Monday, October 12, 2009 6:48 PM"}, {"id": "C05764806", "title": "TREMENDOUS THANKS TO SECRETARY CLINTON", "prompt": "FYI", "graph": {"nodes": [], "edges": []}, "From": "Mills, Cheryl D", "Date": "Tuesday, October 13, 2009 6:44 PM"}, {"id": "C05764813", "title": "TECH DEL ROCKS", "prompt": "Fyi", "graph": {"nodes": [], "edges": []}, "From": "Mills, Cheryl D", "Date": "Wednesday, October 14, 2009 10:09 PM"}, {"id": "C05764818", "title": "REWARDS FOR JUSTICE", "prompt": "FYI", "graph": {"nodes": [], "edges": []}, "From": "Mills, Cheryl D", "Date": "Thursday, October 15, 2009 12:15 AM"}, {"id": "C05764825", "title": "WORLD FOOD PRIZE - CHAIR AND CEO OF PEPSICO AND SEC.

SID", "prompt": "Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'special\nrelationship' sinks to new low\nGordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama\nduring his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of\nthe Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left \"the special relationship\"\nat its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.\nBy Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York\nPublished: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009\nBritish officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy\nchange in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.\nBut the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing\non his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York\nkitchen.\nThe setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point\nsince John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.\nIt was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the\nPresident hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that\nthis was not unusual.\nHowever, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had\nbeen a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.\n\"It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone,\" the source said.\n\"There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off.\"\nThe most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on\nsupplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.\nAs a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior\nsource. However, the meeting never happened.\nThe White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would\n\"spend all day Friday together.\" However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world\nleaders.\nThe release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the\nnew chill in relations between Washington and London.\nMr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.\nDowning Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.\nMr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.\nNearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families\nof victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made\nspeeches.\nLast night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal\ndiscussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The\n15-minute \"walk and chat\" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in\nManhattan.\nNo 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate \"bilateral\"\nmeeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting\nwith Mr Obama.\nIn a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must \"move in a new direction\" and \"embrace20a\nnew era of engagement\". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on\nrelations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor\nrelationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close\nfriendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.\nJohn Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had\ntried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's\nstudent past at Oxford \u2014 something Sir John has always denied.\nMr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for\n96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.\nKathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to\nNew York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of\njustice for victims families.\nThe Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order\nto safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.\nShirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than\nhuman rights.\nMr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guests\npaid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Barack Obama", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Gordon Brown",

Some examples of the work thus far:\n\u2022 The civilian surge in Afghanistan is on pace to meet targets by end of year.\n\u2022 Our approach to assistance in Afghanistan has changed dramatically, both through the\nconsolidation of efforts under Tony Wayne and the review (and sometimes rejection) of\nassistance contracts.\n\u2022\n\u2022 Holbrooke has opened and is actively pursuing R/R channels.\n\u2022 The swift and comprehensive U.S. response helped alleviate and reduce the impact of the\nSwat refugee crisis.\n\u2022\n\u2022 The trilateral meetings have helped create conditions for progress on key cross-border\nissues.\n)11\n\u2022 Holbrooke's international diplomacy \u2014 in the Gulf, with China, with the cadre of other\nspecial representatives \u2014 has translated into funding and equipment commitments, more\nbuy-in, and more patience.\nHolbrooke has been a key driver of (non-military) strategic innovation in Afghanistan and\nPakistan. Here are some examples:Ill\nDefining a regional approach to Af/Pak (including trilateral summits)\n\u2022 The regional approach championed by Holbrooke became a central feature of the Reidel\nreport; the trilats are a pure Holbrooke invention\nAfghanistan\nThe clearest voice and thinker on swifter and more heavily resourced \"Afghanization\" -\nprimarily by standing up a sufficiently large and sufficiently capable ANSF \u2014 as the preferable\nalternative to adding more troops.\n\u2022 The Reidel report calls for training 134,000 army and 82,000 police over two years;\nHolbrooke is working through a strategy that would more than double those numbers and\nspeed the pace of training. Such a strategy has to resolve significant obstacles,\nparticularly with respect to the police.\nFraming and executing the U.S. approach to Afghan elections:\n\u2022\nDeveloping a strategy \u2014 in partnership with the Afghan government and others \u2014 for pursuing\nreconciliation/reintegration.\n\u2022 The Reidel report discusses support for the Afghan government's efforts to reintegrate\n\"non ideologically-committed\" insurgents who lay down their arms, renounce al Qaeda,\nand accept the Afghan Constitution. Holbrooke was key in developing this aspect of the\nreport, and is now working through the next phases.\nPrioritizing a shift in emphasis on counternarcotics from eradication to interdiction\n\u2022 The Reidel report discusses the need for increased interdiction efforts \u2014 and the attendant\nneed to support licit agriculture to shift livelihoods.\nEmphasizing and executing our engagement with Arab allies, China, and Turkey\n\u2022 The Reidel report speaks generally about engaging all those with a stake in the region. It\ndoes not lay out a specific diplomatic strategy or priority countries.\n\u2022 [NOTE:\n\u2022 This issue does not get extensive treatment in the Reidel report.\nPakistan\n\u2022 The Reidel report does not speak in any detail to this issue.\nResponding decisively to the refugee crisis in Swat and Buner\n\u2022 Obviously, the Reidel report does not address this. The immediate response to the\nrefugee crisis was Holbrooke's team at its finest.\nMaking the image of the United States in Pakistan as a critical strategic priority\n\u2022 The Reidel report focuses on strategic communications in Afghanistan. Holbrooke's\nrecent trip with Judith McHale is the latest in an ongoing effort to develop a strategic\ncommunications plan for Pakistan. Generally, Holbrooke, along with McDonough, has\nbeen the key mover on all things related to strategic communications in both Afghanistan\nand Pakistan; he has a good sense of what is missing and what is needed.\nPursuing a major new energy initiative to address Pakistan's economic troubles and boost\nsupport for the United States\n\u2022 The Reidel report mentions energy as a key sector where we should be encouraging\nforeign investment.\n1.

How our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial.\nUnfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of demagoguery and distortion,\nincluding invocations of Hitler and fear-mongering about \"death panels.\" As a result of these\nattacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress\nhave abandoned support for end-of-life counseling.\nOur family's experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and\nthe misguidedness of the campaign against it. Brooke Shearer -- wife, mother and grandmother\n-- had been fighting cancer for more than a year. She had undergone major surgery, numerous\nscans and biopsies, and two debilitating courses of chemotherapy. Her doctors were among the\nbest in their fields. Their expertise did not, however, extend to the fine points of, and latest\nadvances in, pain management.\nBrooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her\nfamily for whatever time we had together. With that goal in mind, she sought advice and\ntreatment from palliative-care specialists at Washington Home and Community Hospices. Their\ningenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her discomfort in her\nfinal months. Working closely with her primary physicians, the hospice staff helped Brooke\nanticipate the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and\nexercise a degree of control over both her own condition and our family's adjustment to it.\nWhen her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fully\ninto the hands of Washington Home as an outpatient. Regular house calls by hospice doctors,\nnurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects, spend time with\nfriends and family, and end her life at home, which was a considerable comfort to her and to us.\nThese, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. However, controlling\nthe cost of health care -- especially in the last year of life -- is an important part of the current\nnational debate. Therefore it is worth noting that Brooke's treatment in the last stages of her\nillness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year.\nIt has often been said that dying can be a full-time job. That was emphatically not the case with\nBrooke. Until her final days, she concentrated on living -- a choice that end-of-life counseling\nhelped make possible. Hospice care more than meets the standard of the Hippocratic oath: It not\nonly does no harm -- it does good; it is not about hastening death but enhancing life. If\ncounseling about hospice services and palliative care is a beneficiary of health care reform,\nmany Americans will be as well.\nDevin Talbott, along with his brother Adrian, is co-founder of GenerationEngage.

That's more than Vice President Joe\nBiden, who's currently next in line for the presidency.\nAccording to the poll, 28 percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White House, with seven in 10 saying the\nformer Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is not qualified.\nThe survey indicates that a majority of Republicans, 54 percent, feel Palin is qualified, with 44 percent indicating she\nisn't. But only 29 percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president, with 68 percent\ndisagreeing. According to the poll, nine in 10 Democrats feel Palin is not qualified.\nThe poll's release comes one day before the release of Palin's book, \"Going Rogue: An American Life.\"\n\"The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOP\nnomination in 2012 - Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee,\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.\nAccording to the survey, nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president, with 43 percent feeling\nthe same way about Huckabee. Among Republicans, Palin is still lagging other potential 2012 primary candidates: 63\npercent of GOPers think that Romney and Huckabee are qualified, 9 points higher than the number that say the same of\nPalin.\"\nPalin has many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician, that she\ncares about average Americans, and that she is honest and trustworthy,\" says Holland. \"But the perception that she is\nnot qualified for the White House is her biggest Achilles heel.\"An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released Monday\nindicates that 38 percent of Americans say Palin's qualified to serve as president, with six in 10 saying she's not qualified.\nThe CNN survey indicates that 67 percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office,\n17 points higher than the 50 percent of Americans who think that Biden's qualified to take over as president.Biden's low\nnumber may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama/Biden administration rather than views of Biden\npersonally.\"\nIn the past, poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president,\" say\nHolland. Polls from the late 1990s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president, but only if\nrespondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications, he\nadds. In the Bush administration, the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as the\nadministration grew more unpopular. \"Cheney's experience in office didn't change during that period - attitudes toward\nthe Bush/Cheney administration did,\" he says.\nHillary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates, including health care,\nthe economic stimulus, and other controversial matters, while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policy,\nHolland adds, while Biden has been involved in the domestic policy disputes - \"which might explain why some\nrespondents were looking for a reason to say something negative about the veep.\"\nThe CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by\ntelephone.

Sid\nReturn to the Article\nNovember 13, 2009\nCan the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?\nBy Sean Trende\nJohn Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in\nVirginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to\nupper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if\nimitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.\nDemocrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's\ncoalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily\nsuccessful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election\nof the most liberal President in American History last year.\nGiven this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in\nVirginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote \u2014 the highest percentage (though\nnot the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the\nGOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse \u2014 five Democrats won their Assembly\nraces by fewer than 1,000 votes.\nThere are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is\ntoo damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin \u2014 that their weakness\namong Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their\nRepublican voting habits \u2014 puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in\nelections.\nBut the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of\nthe mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democratic\ncoalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.\nThe historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:\nCulturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began\nbreaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s \u2014 their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks and\nliberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.\nBut this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals,\nurban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a\nmoderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a\ncombination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation\nfor Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the\nRepublican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by\neight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more.\nClinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan \u2014 they don't like it when you call\nsomeone \"macaca,\" and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either,\nand are fans of \"law and order.\" They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean\nenvironment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced\nbudgets are the ultimate \"good government\" indicator for these voters.\nClinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term.\nIn so doing \u2014 and this is very important \u2014 he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic\ngrowth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the \"Carter\" label for the Democrats. This,\nin turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -\none that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.\nGeorge W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda,\na fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more\nheavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around ,\nmajor metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put\ntogether a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites.\nThe mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.\nBut the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the\nstage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama\nreceived 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.\nObama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the\nremaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced with\nvanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were\nenthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black\nPresident.\nBut this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites,\npoor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the\nparty gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the\ndoor, the party isn't left with much.\nWe see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look at\nthe counties that Mark Warner won.\nThe coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the\nmining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites\nin the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition,\nbut it worked.\nNow let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:\nThe suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area\nbecomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale,\nand Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in\nduring the 1920s.\nAs I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than\nObama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the\nJacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed \u2014 at\nleast on paper \u2014 capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginia\nchanged from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:\nThe redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward\nDemocrats.\nWe see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs \u2014 but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC\nsuburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton\nRoads. Its rural Virginia \u2014 which is still about 1/3 of the electorate \u2014 that made the difference between Bush's 54% in\n2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the\nticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican.\nWe can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let's\ncompare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at \"relative movement.\" Because\neverything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing \"movement\" would be solid dark red, and not of\nmuch use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved\nless than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].\nWe see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven't\nmoved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern\nportion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This\nsuggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.\nNow let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so\ndramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at \"relative\" shifts.\nThe western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving Republicans\naround 70% of the vote \u2014 there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember, \"blue\" in a relative map still\nmeans slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in\nthe DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.\nIn other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to\nwin without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the\nClinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.\nThis is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is\nvery, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, to\nmake an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion\ndollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade\nmake suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at\nsome point \u2014 probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first\nyear, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise to\nenact a net spending cut any more.\nDemocrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when the\nmood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out\nwhen he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death\npenalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18\npoints, even holding everything else equal.\nThe other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in\nthe House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs\nvoted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote like\nit did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd\nWhitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative\nRepublicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the\noutskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figures\nprominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive\nthere with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen\nhis attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters.\nStates with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't moved\nmuch against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and\nSenator, in classic \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of\ncourse in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%.\nThis doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other\nfactors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls\nto enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting to\nshow its downside for downticket Democrats.\nThe Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could find\nthemselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.\nSean Trende can be reached at

Wrong. Conditions in the U.S. labor markets are awful and worsening. While the official\nunemployment rate is already 10.2% and another 200,000 jobs were lost in October, when you include discouraged\nworkers and partially employed workers the figure is a whopping 17.5%.\nWhile losing 200,000 jobs per month is better than the 700,000 jobs lost in January, current job losses still average more\nthan the per month rate of 150,000 during the last recession.\nAlso, remember: The last recession ended in November 2001, but job losses continued for more than a year and half until\nJune of 2003; ditto for the 1990-91 recession.\nSo we can expect that job losses will continue until the end of 2010 at the earliest. In other words, if you are unemployed\nand looking for work and just waiting for the economy to turn the corner, you had better hunker down. All the economic\nnumbers suggest this will take a while. The jobs just are not coming back.\nThere's really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around: a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus with\nanother round of labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state and local governments\nand provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers. Helping the unemployed just by extending\nunemployment benefits is necessary not sufficient; it leads to persistent unemployment rather than job creation.\nThe long-term picture for workers and families is even worse than current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now as\na way of sharing the pain, many firms are telling their workers to cut hours, take furloughs and accept lower wages.\nSpecifically, that fall in hours worked is equivalent to another 3 million full time jobs lost on top of the 7.5 million jobs\nformally lost.\nThis is very bad news but we must face facts. Many of the lost jobs are gone forever, including construction jobs, finance\njobs and manufacturing jobs. Recent studies suggest that a quarter of U.S. jobs are fully out-sourceable over time to other\ncountries.\nOther measures tell the same ugly story: The average length of unemployment is at an all time high; the ratio of job\napplicants to vacancies is 6 to 1; initial claims are down but continued claims are very high and now millions of\nunemployed are resorting to the exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs and are staying in them longer.\nBased on my best judgment, it is most likely that the unemployment rate will peak close to 11% and will remain at a very\nhigh level for two years or more.\nThe weakness in labor markets and the sharp fall in labor income ensure a weak recovery of private consumption and an\nanemic recovery of the economy, and increases the risk of a double dip recession.\nAs a result of these terribly weak labor markets, we can expect weak recovery of consumption and economic growth;\nlarger budget deficits; greater delinquencies in residential and commercial real estate and greater fall in home and\ncommercial real estate prices; greater losses for banks and financial institutions on residential and commercial real estate\nmortgages, and in credit cards, auto loans and student loans and thus a greater rate of failures of banks; and greater\nprotectionist,pressures.\nThe damage will be extensive and severe unless bold policy action is undertaken now.\nRoubini is professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University and Chairman of Roubini\nGlobal Economics.\nRead more:

Mine concerns international economics:\nI predict that 2010 will be the year of China. And not in a good way.\nActually, the biggest problems with China involve climate change. But today I want to focus on currency policy.\nChina has become a major financial and trade power. But it doesn't act like other big economies. Instead, it follows a\nmercantilist policy, keeping its trade surplus artificially high. And in today's depressed world, that policy is, to put it bluntly,\npredatory.\nHere's how it works: Unlike the dollar, the euro or the yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China's currency is pegged by\nofficial policy at about 6.8 yuan to the dollar. At this exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing has a large cost advantage\nover its rivals, leading to huge trade surpluses.\nUnder normal circumstances, the inflow of dollars from those surpluses would push up the value of China's currency,\nunless it was offset by private investors heading the other way. And private investors are trying to get into China, not out\nof it. But China's government restricts capital inflows, even as it buys up dollars and parks them abroad, adding to a $2\ntrillion-plus hoard of foreign exchange reserves.\nThis policy is good for China's export-oriented state-industrial complex, not so good for Chinese consumers. But what\nabout the rest of us?\nIn the past, China's accumulation of foreign reserves, many of which were invested in American bonds, was arguably\ndoing us a favor by keeping interest rates low \u2014 although what we did with those low interest rates was mainly to inflate a\nhousing bubble. But right now the world is awash in cheap money, looking for someplace to go. Short-term interest rates\nare close to zero; long-term interest rates are higher, but only because investors expect the zero-rate policy to end some\nday. China's bond purchases make little or no difference.\nMeanwhile, that trade surplus drains much-needed demand away from a depressed world economy. My back-of-the-\nenvelope calculations suggest that for the next couple of years Chinese mercantilism may end up reducing U.S.\nemployment by around 1.4 million jobs.\nThe Chinese refuse to acknowledge the problem. Recently Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints:\n\"On one hand, you are asking for the yuan to appreciate, and on the other hand, you are taking all kinds of protectionist\nmeasures.\" Indeed: other countries are taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely because China refuses to let its\ncurrency rise. And more such measures are entirely appropriate.\nOr are they? I usually hear two reasons for not confronting China over its policies. Neither holds water.\nFirst, there's the claim that we can't confront the Chinese because they would wreak havoc with the U.S. economy by\ndumping their hoard of dollars. This is all wrong, and not just because in so doing the Chinese would inflict large losses on\nthemselves. The larger point is that the same forces that make Chinese mercantilism so damaging right now also mean\nthat China has little or no financial leverage.\nAgain, right now the world is awash in cheap money. So if China were to start selling dollars, there's no reason to think it\nwould significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies \u2014 but that would\nbe good, not bad, for U.S. competitiveness and employment. So if the Chinese do dump dollars, we should send them a\nthank-you note.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Krugman", "type": "person"}, {"id": "January 1, 2010", "type": "date"}, {"id": "Op-Ed

He was a good person and was one of your biggest fans.\nWomen and work\nWe did it!\nDec 30th 2009\nFrom The Economist print edition\nThe rich world's quiet revolution: women are\ngradually taking over the workplace\nGetty Images\nAT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration, here is a candidate:\nwithin the next few months women will cross the 50% threshold and become the\nmajority of the American workforce. Women already make up the majority of\nuniversity graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional\nworkers in several rich countries, including the United States. Women run many\nof the world's great companies, from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France.\nWomen's economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our\ntimes. Just a generation ago, women were largely confined to repetitive, menial\njobs. They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to\nabandon their careers when they married and had children. Today they are\nrunning some of the organisations that once treated them as second-class\ncitizens. Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives.\nAnd millions of brains have been put to more productive use. Societies that try to\nresist this trend\u2014most notably the Arab countries, but also Japan and some\nsouthern European countries\u2014will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent\nand frustrated citizens.\nThis revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction (see article).\nMen have, by and large, welcomed women's invasion of the workplace. Yet even\nthe most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory. This particular\nadvance comes with two stings. The first is that women are still under-\nrepresented at the top of companies. Only 2% of the bosses of America's largest\ncompanies and 5% of their peers in Britain are women. They are also paid\nsignificantly less than men on average. The second is that juggling work and\nchild-rearing is difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain that they have\ntoo little time for their children. But the biggest losers are poor children\u2014\nparticularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of\nfemale participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money\non child care.\nDealing with the juggle\nThese two problems are closely related. Many women feel they have to choose\nbetween their children and their careers. Women who prosper in high-pressure\ncompanies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and then\nfind it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum. Less-skilled women\nare trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements.\nMotherhood, not sexism, is the issue: in America, childless women earn almost as\nmuch as men, but mothers earn significantly less. And those mothers' relative\npoverty also disadvantages their children.\nDemand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems. Even if\nsome of the new theories about warm-hearted women making inherently superior\nworkers are bunk (see article), several trends favour the more educated sex,\nincluding the \"war for talent\" and the growing flexibility of the workplace. Law\nfirms, consultancies and banks are rethinking their \"up or out\" promotion systems\nbecause they are losing so many able women. More than 90% of companies in\nGermany and Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology is making it\neasier to redesign work in all sorts of family-friendly ways.\nWomen have certainly performed better over the past decade than men. In the\nEuropean Union women have filled 6m of the 8m new jobs created since 2000. In\nAmerica three out of four people thrown out of work since the \"mancession\"\nbegan have been male. And the shift towards women is likely to continue: by\n2011 there will be 2.6m more female than male university students in America.\nThe light hand of the state\nAll this argues, mostly, for letting the market do the work. That has not stopped\ncalls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort. Norway has used\nthreats of quotas to dramatic effect. Some 40% of the legislators there are\nwomen. All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state-financed nurseries.\nThey have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of\nthe social problems that plague Britain and America. Surely, comes the argument,\nthere is a way to speed up the revolution\u2014and improve the tough lives of many\nworking women and their children?\nIf that means massive intervention, in the shape of affirmative-action\nprogrammes and across-the-board benefits for parents of all sorts, the answer is\nno. To begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and\nunfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries. And there are practical problems. Lengthy\nperiods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women, which helps\nexplain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a\nlower proportion of women in management than America does.\nBut there are plenty of cheaper, subtler ways in which governments can make life\neasier for women. Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at\nhome. They need to change the way they operate. German schools, for instance,\nclose at midday. American schools shut down for two months in the summer.\nThese things can be changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter\nschools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays. And, without\ngoing to Scandinavian lengths, America could invest more in its children: it\nspends a lower share of its GDP on public child-care than almost any other rich\ncountry, and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid\nmaternity leave. Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric\nabout \"real family values\".\nStill, these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that\nwomen have made in recent decades. During the second world war, when\nAmerica's menfolk were off at the front, the government had to summon up the\nimage of Rosie the Riveter, with her flexed muscle and \"We Can Do It\" slogan, to\nencourage women into the workforce. Today women are marching into the\nworkplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remaining\nglass ceilings.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Economist", "type": "magazine"}, {"id":

Obama, in contrast, had a 51 percent\napproval and a 45 percent disapproval rating.\nThe Secretary of State has conducted several well-received foreign trips in recent months and has\nnot been as closely identified with the more contentious elements of the Administration's agenda,\nincluding the health care fight, the federal deficit and the Wall Street bailouts. And she has not been\nsubjected to nearly the same media and partisan scrutiny as the president. Obama, meanwhile, has\nbeen on national television on a daily basis tackling a wide range of difficult issues.\nThe poll was conducted by the nonpartisan Clarus Research Group from December 7th to the 12th,\nand it asked for opinions of the top Cabinet secretaries and White House officials. Its finding on\nObama and Clinton mirrors that of earlier polls \u2014 in October, for example, a Gallup poll found that\nClinton had become more popular than the president.\nClarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason for Clinton's high poll numbers is her high approval\namong Republicans \u2014 numbers he said position her well to run for president again in the future, if she\nchooses. Clinton had 96 percent approval among Democrats, a healthy 57 percent approval among\nRepublicans, and 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama was nearly as popular among\nDemocrats \u2014 93 percent \u2014 but his numbers among Republicans and Independents fell off\ndramatically, at 19 percent and 33 percent respectively.\nClinton's Republican numbers are striking, given how intensely disliked she has been in the past\namong GOP voters. In fact, part of Obama's appeal to Democratic primary voters in 2008 was that he\nwas more likely to be able to bridge the partisan divide than Clinton, who was by then a well-known\nfigure dating to her time as first lady in the 1990s.\n\"Republicans may see her as being more hawkish than other Democrats on foreign policy issues,\"\nsaid Faucheux. \"It may be a way for them to bolster that position within the administration.\" Asked\nabout any future Clinton presidential bid, he said, \"She's in good shape now.\"\nThe next highest-rated cabinet secretary in the survey was Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who\nnotched a 69 percent overall approval rate with a 78 percent approval among Democrats and 63\npercent among both Republicans and independents.\n\"Both Clinton and Gates did well across the partisan board,\" said Faucheux. \"Everybody else did well\namong Democrats but fell off among Republicans.\"\nAnother trend spotted by the pollsters: Approval ratings inside the Beltway were higher than in the\nrest of the country. \"These results show that the 'Beltway echo chamber' does not reflect the rest of\nthe country, even among news watchers,\" said Faucheux.\nAmong White House staffers and advisors, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs \u2014 who is often seen on\ntelevision \u2014 had the highest overall rating at 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers had the\nlowest approval, at 25 percent.\nSummers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner \u2014 who are both closely associated with the\neconomy \u2014 both posted higher disapproval numbers than approval. Summers' disapproval rating was\n41 percent. Geithner's disapproval rating was 45 percent, one point higher than his approval rating.\nThe poll also found that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who is often viewed as having\nsharp partisan elbows, scored much higher among Democrats, at 72 percent, than Republicans, at 13\npercent.\nAmong other major administration officials, Vice President Joe Biden had a 50 percent approval and\n41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\nboth posted 41 percent approval and 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrod\nscored 38 percent approval and 36 percent disapproval; and National Security Adviser James Jones\nhad a 30 percent approval and 23 percent disapproval rating.\nNora Toiv\nOffice of the

Please let me know what you think:\nStatement by the Secretary\nOn the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009\nThe United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake\nof the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization\nof American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they\nagreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national\nreconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya\"s restitution. These are vital elements of the\nTegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious\ndetermination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.\nThe November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional\norder in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates\nrepresenting parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under\nthe stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral\nrenewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable\nexpression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their\nnew leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.\nThe holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the\ndemocratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the\nregion, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for\nthe Honduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a unique\nopportunity to promote that vital mission.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "statement", "type": "document"}, {"id": "Secretary", "type": "person"}, {"id": "November 27, 2009", "type": "date"}, {"id": "United States", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Honduras", "type": "country"}, {"id": "June 28", "type": "date"}, {"id": "President Zelaya", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Organization of American States", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord", "type": "agreement"}, {"id": "government of unity and national reconciliation", "type": "government"}, {"id": "December 2", "type": "date"}, {"id": "Congressional vote", "type": "event"}, {"id": "national elections", "type": "event"}, {"id": "Supreme Electoral Tribunal", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates", "type": "government"}, {"id": "president-elect", "type": "person"}], "edges": [{"source": "statement", "target": "Secretary", "label": "author"}, {"source": "statement", "target": "November 27, 2009", "label": "date"}, {"source": "United States", "target": "Honduras", "label": "support"}, {"source": "June 28", "target": "President Zelaya", "label": "coup"}, {"source": "June 28", "target": "Organization of American States", "label": "suspension"}, {"source": "Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord", "target": "government of unity and national reconciliation", "label": "implementation"}, {"source": "Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord", "target": "December 2", "label": "congressional vote"}, {"source": "national elections", "target": "Honduras", "label": "restoration"}, {"source": "Supreme Electoral Tribunal", "target": "presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates", "label": "stewardship"}, {"source": "Honduran constitution", "target": "presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates", "label": "enshrined"}, {"source": "national elections", "target": "Honduran constitution", "label": "expression"}, {"source": "Honduras", "target": "new leaders", "label": "choose"}, {"source": "election", "target": "Honduras", "label": "necessary"}, {"source": "election", "target": "Honduras", "label": "not sufficient"}, {"source": "election", "target": "Honduras", "label": "free, fair and transparent"}, {"source": "Honduras", "target": "Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord", "label": "implementation"}, {"source": "Honduras", "target": "president-elect", "label": "emerges"}]}, "From": "Sullivan, Jacob J", "Date": "Thursday, November 26, 2009 6:11 PM"}, {"id": "C05766481", "title": "MESSAGE FROM JOHNNIE CARSON - UGANDA HATE CRIMES", "prompt": "See traffic below \u2014 read down", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "traffic", "type": "website_traffic"}], "edges": []}, "From": "Mills, Cheryl D", "Date": "Saturday, October 24, 2009 10:23 AM"}, {"id": "C05766484", "title": "HONDURAS STATEMENT", "prompt": "Of course!", "graph": {"nodes": [], "edges": []}, "From": "Sullivan, Jacob J", "Date": "Thursday, November 26, 2009 8:09 PM"}, {"id": "C05766486", "title": "PARADE", "prompt": "Photo is gorgeous (and there are 20 more online, some are really great)\nThe article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didn't include a lot of the great stuff he saw that\nday.

The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion\ncontinued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her\nrelationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)\nWoodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks\nare. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push\non today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to\nwind up today and resume on Monday.\nBrown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.\nThe issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within\nthe DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too\nmuch. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also\nmoved.\nThe DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal\nDodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework\nrequires consultation, legislation, and implementation.\nThe role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed.

But within a few months of being sworn in, the President and his top aides were sitting\ndown with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care reform\npossible.\nOver the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of\ntimes to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration's health care reform agenda in\nexchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president's promises to reform the pharmaceutical\nindustry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push\ntheir case. How they did it--pieced together from news accounts, disclosure forms including lobbying reports and Federal\nElection Commission records, White House visitor logs and the sghedu! ..S,:::in. Max,Baucus releases yoiun:tarily--is a\ntestament to how ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington.\nIn the 2008 campaign, Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nation's health\ncare system, but also supported key qemocr.atic health reform uok,\nsies. Among these were several that targeted the\npharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices and providing\nMedicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program. These weren't\njust promises, Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Rdl Call Vote 132 and Roll call Vo.t.c.-)\n150.)\nSet to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled in the monied Washington culture, chief of staff\nRahm Emanuel and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina. Emanuel was a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official,\ninvestment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in Congress. Messina was the former campaign manager\nB6\nand chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their\nunparalleled legislative abilities.\nBecause of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process, members of Congress also\nplayed key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee\nchairman Max Bpuf.\n-4:s. Baucus would be the vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House and\nPhRMA.\nCentral to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a longtime Democratic member of\nCongress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties\nTauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy &\nCommerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription\ndrug access to Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare would\nnot be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not be\nallowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and would be taking a\njob helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million.\nTauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of\n2008 simply titled \".Biliy.\" It featured the candidate, sleeves rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the\nways of Washington. \"The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate\nwith drug companies. And you know what, the chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for\nthe pharmaceutical industry making $2 million a year.\" The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that, \"Barack\nObama is the only candidate who refuses Washington lobbyist money,\" while the candidate continues his lecture,\n\"Imagine that. That's an example of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I don't want to learn how to\nplay the game better, I want to put an end to the game playing.\"\nAiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities.\nOver the course of 2009, the drug industry trade group sdeft:tow::!i: _ 520 tniliion on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from\nPhRMA's massive in-house lobbying operation, the trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number of\nlobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165 lobbyists representing PhRMA were former\nemployees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens were former congressional staffers including\ntwo former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.\nAccording to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers coptr.ibu\u25a0ed sums to ....:ongressional\necii-om.lttee.s during the same period--from January to the end of October (4thquarter numbers are still being\ntotaled), industry political action committees, employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million.\nThose contributions tilted heavily to Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in any\nelection cycle going back to 1990, the first year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that\nDemocrats were so favored. Given their majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new President's intention to reform America's\nhealth care system, the new tilt was perhaps not surprising.\nOn March 5, the White House a Tee.tiilfa....ivitfi.rnnic!r_nealth care induLd.er.s to try to bring them to the table and\nsee what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, president, CEO and top lobbyist for\nPhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, America's Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman Karen lgnani, Tom Donohue of the\nChamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations' Rise Lavizzomourey. A day before the White House\nmeeting Tauzin 31)12.7.a_f;=\u25a0.:4_1\n.7...-1 Ci\\IF:\n.\n.lc touting health care reform and promising to work closely with the Obama\nadministration. In the interview he touted it as an \"optimistic plan\", acknowledging that the industry did have a few\nproblems but was glad to have a chance to discuss these. Spme were duri?0,7rognnd,,\n,td by this apparent change of\nheart on behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms.\nOn April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a\nmeeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor\nand health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promote\nreform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entftelv funoed pj\n.\nPhRMA. The two groups spent $24 million on their advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went to\nWhite House Senior Advisor David AKPD, which owed Axelrod $2 million.\nIn the next month, CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at least\nfour times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health\ncare reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups piedaed cost ,\n..-v_itting_measures to the White House that\nwould save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade. President Obama announced the deal in the State\nDining Room, flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the administration followed up with a media blitz in the press\nand on the White House Web site.\nThe next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement in support of the health\ncare reform process calling for the government to finally \"fix\" the nation's health care cost problems. While many elements\nof the $2 trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that they\ncould ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House:\nThe first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives, including Tauzin, and industry\nCEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly available\nschedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committee\nchairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.\nIn a press release featuring a statement by Tauzin, Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted $80\nbillion in cost cutting measures to be included in the Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news\nre_gorts, Baucus initially proposed $100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the executives and lobbyists meeting on June\n2 were able to win the lower figure.\nThe terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the \"donut hole\" in Medicare\nprescription drug coverage. The \"donut hole\" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare prescription\ndrug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at $2,700 spent\nand does not pick back up again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal; 50 percent\ncoverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not completely close the \"donut hole.\"\nIn Baucus' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we\ncan make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today.\" This \"once-in-a-lifetime\" opportunity also extended to the\npharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through\nMedicare negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grand\nstatement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the White\nHouse and Democrats to take certain chips off the table.\nBaucus proceeded with a_pia,n c.c)r\n.ivene.a bicartisap rimuo in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White House.\nThese participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi and\nOlympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry - which were\nreliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to meet the\nWhite House's announced iltuouet reces\u00a7 dee&rie for passing health care reform.\nSoon after, PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on July 7 and this time met with\nRehm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus' chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this\nmeeting). In August, The Huffirytorj. !Dosi',.\n--; Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that\noutlined the policies that would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicare\nprescription drug negotiations, drug re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part D\nand Part B. The deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more.\n***\nWhile the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee, other congressional committees continued to mark-up their\nown versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the\nfinal product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the\n$80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gotten\nthe White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation. Medicare negotiating power\nand speedier release of generics to the market. According to previous analysis of the measures proposed by the\ncommittee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts, far exceeding the $80 billion cap agreed\nto by the White House, Baucus and PhRMA.\nThe cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA, which included all of the\nCEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public\nwith the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On August 4, the Los Ancg\u20223les\u2022Firrief-\n,\n-\n:, in\nan exclusive report, featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed and\nthat, as Tauzin put it, \"The White House blessed it.\" Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, \"For his part, Tauzin said he had\nnot only received the White House pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to\npursue another proposal Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe.\"\nThe White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, \"The president encouraged this approach ... He\nwanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform.\"\nDemocratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijaiva, chairman of the Progressive Caucus, asked, \"Are industry groups\ngoing to be the ones at the table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?\"\n***\nOn September 7, Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed\n$80 billion. Five days later, the New York :limes reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an\nadvertising blitz in support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending \"...would be a follow-up to the deal that\ndrug makers struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the White House.\" On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his\nles.j\n.islation to the public. t\nThe White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendment\ntargeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest\nMedicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to push\nfor further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the \"donut hole\" completely.\nNelson claimed that his amendment would onerate $106 billion in revenue, or from PhRMA's perspective increase their\ncost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to the\npharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper and Robert Menendez voted with\nRepublicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment. It is little surprise the Carper's Delaware is home to\nAstraZeneca and Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-Squibb, all of which lobbied for the $80\nbillion cap.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in place, on November 19. Debate began on Dec.\n3, and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced an\namendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting drew near, the Federal Drug Administration\n(FDA) released a letter objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: \"...as currently\nwritten, the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there are\nsignificant safety concerns.\" Dorgan's amendment was defeated with numerous Democrats previously in support of\nreimportation switching to \"no\" votes.\nOn Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.\n***\nNew Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform bill\nhad been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator Ted\nKennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be the\nsenator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover.\nDespite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the brakes on their agenda, particularly\nhealth care reform.\nin the end, the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform would be left up in the air. After spending $100\nmillion in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the\npharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In February, the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut by\nTauzin, pushedjauzin to_res\n..i\n.s., his .post.\nIn an interview with Diane Sawvqf., President Obama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care reform,\n\"[The health care debate as it unfolded legitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents, but also amongst\nsupporters that we just don't know what's going on ... And it's an ugly process and it looks like there are a bunch of back\nroom deals.\"", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Huffington Post", "type": "news_outlet"}, {"id": "Huffington Post story", "type":

A\ntranscript of the interview has not been posted yet, but I have included here the Financial Times article about the\ninterview. Please just let me know if you would like any further information on this.\nBest,\nMike\nFormer aide urges Obama to regain 'political narrative'\nBy Edward Luce in Washington\nPublished: February 15 2010\nBarack Obama, US president, has lost control of the political narrative and needs to make more use of his cabinet in\norder to regain it, says John Podesta, the man who headed the president's transition team.\n\"My friends in the White House would agree with this, that they lost the narrative,\" Mr Podesta said in an interview for\nView from DC, the Financial Times' video series from Washington. \"Clearly that needs not one speech once in a while: it\nneeds, I think, to be constantly reinforced. And not just by the president, but by his entire team ... He's got a terrific\ncabinet. Use it. Get out into the country and use it.\"\nMr Podesta, who was also a chief of staff to Bill Clinton, drew parallels with the former president's difficulties in his first\ntwo years, which culminated in the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress following the failure of healthcare reform.\nWhen asked whether the failure of this latest attempt at healthcare reform would result in a similar electoral\n\"massacre\" for the Democratic party at the mid-term elections in November, he said: \"I subscribe to that view.\"\nMr Podesta founded the Centre for American Progress, Washington's largest liberal think-tank, which was often\ndescribed as a \"government-in-exile\" during the years George W. Bush was in the White House. He said Mr Obama had\nthree options with healthcare reform. First, try to enact the whole thing by using the budget reconciliation process,\nwhich would enable it to pass with 51 votes. The Democrats lost their controlling 60-seat super-majority last month in a\nelection defeat in Massachusetts.\nThe second would be to pass a watered down bill with Republican support The third would be to abandon the attempt,\nas Mr Clinton did in 1993.\nMr Podesta, whom Mr Obama still regularly consults, said there was still a better than 50:50 chance of getting reform\nthrough. \"The worst option among the three is doing nothing, and so they're going to have to figure out which track is\nviable,\" he said. \"It may mean doing it with only Democratic votes. But if that is such, then so be it.\"\nHe painted a fairly bleak view of the overall health of US politics. \"It sucks,\" he said. Pointing to a strategy of\nobstructionism by Republican lawmakers, he said: \"I think the president is trying to re-engage with Republicans, but,\nquite frankly, he's not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln. He's dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin.\"\nThe growth of partisanship and the increasing difficulty in getting any big reforms through the Senate were threatening\nto turn the US into, \"in essence, a parliamentary system without majority rule\", where the opposition automatically\nopposes any serious initiatives.\nThe political stasis in California provided the writing on the wall for the US as a whole, he said. Since the 1978 passage of\nProposition 13 in the state, all budget changes had required a two-thirds majority. \"And so nothing gets done.\"\nMichael H.

There were no initial\nreports of any injuries in the blast.\nPolice said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were in\nthe process of evacuating the area when the car exploded.\nSuspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after a\nmortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady.\nThe chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry, Gary McKeown, condemned those responsible. \"Lives could have been\nlost as a result of this bombing,\" he said. \"It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community, or the\ncause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs, they should enter the democratic process and debate\nwith their political opponents, rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing.\"\nEarlier this month, police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans.\nPolice in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll, the\nfirst PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province.\nThe Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh, on 9 March\nlast year. His murder came just 48 hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks in\nAntrim. In September police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill.\nOn Sunday, Republican Sinn Fein, political allies of the Continuity IRA, claimed masked undercover soldiers carried out\nsurveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan, Co Armagh, in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting the\nareas in white civilian vans. Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment.\nThe alleged presence of SRR soldiers \u2014 formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit \u2014 is controversial because British\ntroops are meant to have been pulled off the streets, especially in nationalist areas.\nBritain heading for hung parliament\nGuardian/ICM poll\nTories might not win election outright, suggests new survey\n\u2022 Comments (259)\n\u2022 Buzz up!\n\u2022 Digq it\n\u2022 Julian Glover\n\u2022 quardian.co.uk, Monday 22 February 2010 18.30 GMT\n\u2022 Article history\nThe Conservatives should no longer count on winning the election outright, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published\ntoday.\nThe new survey suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament amid faltering public support for David Cameron's\nparty.\nThe opposition have also lost ground on key policy issues, including the economy, and in particular may be losing their\ncampaign against Labour's so-called \"death tax\". Labour leads the Tories by eight points as the party with the best policy\non care for the elderly.\nThe two parties are neck and neck on their ability to sort out the economic crisis, against a nine-point Tory lead when the\nquestion was last asked in August 2009.\nWith no more than three months to go until polling day, the Conservatives have fallen to 37%, down three on last month's\nGuardian/ICM poll and down two on another ICM poll earlier this month.\nThe party has not fallen so low in an ICM poll since the tail end of the banking crisis, last falling to 37% in February 2008.\nAs recently as last October the Tories hit 45% in an ICM poll and the party will be alarmed by this latest evidence that the\nrace is tightening, which confirms the findings of some other recent polls.\nMeanwhile Labour's support, at 30%, is eight points up on its absolute ICM bottom last May, and slightly above its\naverage for the second part of last year. However, there is no sign of either a boost for the party following Gordon Brown's\nPiers Morgan interview or a fall after this weekend's reports about Brown bullying his staff.\nLabour's support is up one point on the last Guardian/ICM poll and unchanged from the most recent ICM poll. Research\nbegan last Friday and most was carried out before the serialisation of Andrew Rawnsley's book in yesterday's Observer,\nwhich may have affected Labour support. Around a fifth of responses were collected on Sunday.\nNick Clegg's hopes of a powerful place in a hung parliament are also boosted by today's poll, which puts the Liberal\nDemocrats on 20%, unchanged from the most recent ICM and down one on last month's Guardian poll.\nAll this suggests that Labour and the Lib Dems are holding steady while the Conservatives lose some ground to smaller\nparties, which are on a total of 13%. Nationalists are on 5%, Ukip and the Greens on 3% each and the BNP on 2%.\nEstimates of what these shares would mean for the parties on polling day vary, but a 7% lead is at the margins of what\nthe Tories think they need to win a majority. One academic calculation suggests the result would leave Labour only 25\nseats behind the Tories in a hung parliament, although any improved Tory performance in marginal seats would offset\nthat.\n\u2022 /CMResearch interviewed a random sample of 1,004 adults by telephone on 19-21 February 2010.

Such an outcome would mean Brown could stay in office and deny Cameron the keys to No 10.\nThe poll result presents the Conservative leader with one of the greatest challenges of his leadership today as he makes\nthe keynote speech to his party's spring forum.\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times, Cameron defied his right-wing critics who believe the party's modernisation has\ngone too far. He said: \"Some people say to me, 'Play things safe; try to win by default \u2014 the government is in a mess.' I\nsay, 'No. This is the Conservative party that is offering radical change. I'm doubling up on change'.\"\nWith the expected May 6 election now just over two months away, Cameron will seek to reconnect with voters through a\nseries of pledges, including a plan to restore discipline in schools. In an echo of the speech that won him the Tory\nleadership in 2005, he will address the Brighton conference without notes.\n\"This is very, very clear,\" he said. \"I've made my choice. There is no going back. This election is about change and we will\nbe offering change.\"\nCameron insisted he was unconcerned about the collapse in Tory support. \"The polls move around a lot,\" he said. \"The\nvoters tell us that they want change. They want to know the Conservative party itself has changed.\"\nThe narrowing of the Conservative lead has been dramatic and rapid. Until January the Tories held close to a 10-point\nlead. But a week ago a Sunday Times YouGov poll put the gap at six points, suggesting a hung parliament, with the\nTories still on course to become the largest party.\nIn the last election, in 2005, support for the parties generally held steady in the run-up to polling day. YouGov polling for\nThe Sunday Times showed Labour leads of between two and five points from January through to the June election.\nLabour's margin of victory was three points.\nIn today's poll, Labour has risen two points on the previous week, from 33%, while the Conservatives have dropped two\nfrom 39%. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 17%.\nThe collapse in the Tory poll lead will put pressure on the pound in financial markets tomorrow by adding to fears that a\nhung parliament will mean insufficient action is taken to cut Britain's budget deficit.\nThe last time the gap between the two main parties came this close and the Tory support was so low was in autumn 2007.\nThat was before Brown's honeymoon ended with his failure to call a snap general election. The Conservatives went on to\npeak in May 2008 with a 26-point lead.\nToday's poll suggests recent claims about Brown's tantrums and his intimidation of staff may have actually helped him.\nJust 28% of people believe the prime minister is a bully and 50% agree he has a \"strong sense of right and wrong\".\nThe survey disclosed growing concerns about Cameron's elite background and lack of empathy with ordinary families.\nJust 25% think that Cameron understands problems faced by \"people like me\", compared with 35% for Brown.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Gordon Brown", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "prime minister", "type": "position"}, {"id": "general election", "type": "event"}, {"id": "Labour", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Tories", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "YouGov survey", "type": "poll"}, {"id": "David Cameron", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "Conservatives", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Sunday Times", "type": "newspaper"}, {"id": "poll result", "type": "outcome"}, {"id": "seats", "type": "political_position"}, {"id": "MPs", "type": "political_position"}, {"id": "keys to No 10", "type": "symbolic_position"}, {"id": "challenges", "type": "difficulty"}, {"id": "leadership", "type": "position"}, {"id": "speech", "type": "communication"}, {"id": "voters", "type": "people"}, {"id": "pledges", "type": "commitment"}, {"id": "discipline in schools", "type": "policy"}, {"id": "Brighton conference", "type": "event"}, {"id": "election", "type": "event"}, {"id": "change", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "support", "type": "backing"}, {"id": "polling day", "type": "event"}, {"id": "Liberal Democrats", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "pound", "type": "currency"}, {"id": "financial markets", "type": "market"}, {"id": "budget deficit", "type": "economic_issue"}, {"id": "tantrums", "type": "behavior"}, {"id": "intimidation of staff", "type": "behavior"}, {"id": "bully", "type": "behavior"}, {"id": "sense of right and wrong", "type": "moral_characteristic"}, {"id": "elite background", "type": "social_status"}, {"id": "empathy with ordinary families", "type": "emotional_connection"}], "edges": [{"source": "Gordon Brown", "target": "prime minister", "label": "position"}, {"source": "Gordon Brown", "target": "general election", "label": "participate_in"}, {"source": "Labour", "target": "YouGov survey", "label": "participate_in"}, {"source": "Tories", "target": "YouGov survey", "label": "participate_in"}, {"source": "YouGov survey", "target": "poll result", "label": "reveal"}, {"source": "Labour", "target": "seats", "label": "heading_for"}, {"source": "Tories", "target": "MPs", "label": "languishing_on"}, {"source": "Tories", "target": "keys to No 10", "label": "deny"}, {"source": "Conservatives", "target": "challenges", "label": "face"}, {"source": "Conservatives", "target": "leadership", "label": "make"}, {"source": "voters", "target": "pledges", "label": "seek"}, {"source": "Cameron", "target": "speech", "label": "make"}, {"source": "Cameron", "target": "election", "label": "address"}, {"source": "Cameron", "target": "change", "label": "offer"}, {"source": "Cameron", "target": "voters", "label": "reconnect_with"}, {"source": "polling day", "target": "election", "label": "occur_on"}, {"source": "Labour", "target": "support", "label": "hold_steady_in"}, {"source": "Conservatives", "target": "support", "label": "hold_steady_in"}, {"source": "Liberal Democrats", "target": "support", "label": "hold_steady_in"}, {"source": "Tories", "target": "pound", "label": "put_pressure_on"}, {"source": "pound", "target": "financial markets", "label": "affect"}, {"source": "hung parliament", "target": "insufficient action", "label": "mean"}, {"source": "gap", "target": "Tory support", "label": "close"}, {"source": "Tory support", "target": "low", "label": "be"}, {"source": "Brown", "target": "tantrums", "label": "accused_of"}, {"source": "Brown", "target": "intimidation of staff", "label": "accused_of"}, {"source": "Brown", "target": "bully", "label": "perceived_as"}, {"source": "Brown", "target": "sense of right and wrong", "label": "perceived_as"}, {"source": "Cameron", "target": "elite background", "label": "criticize_for"}, {"source": "Cameron", "target": "empathy with ordinary families", "label": "lack_of"}]}, "From": "sbwhoeop", "Date": "Saturday, February 27, 2010 11:12 PM"}, {"id": "C05767729", "title": "HAITI - CHILD TRAFFICKING", "prompt": "GTIP is working on it.

Talks between Pakistan and the US for cooperation on atomic\nprogrammes are under way and we want the US to have an agreement with us like the one it had with India on civil\nnuclear technology,\" Mr Haqqani said at a reception hosted by Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer on Sunday.\nHe said Pakistan would get 16 latest F-16 aircraft in June. He said although the expectations of Pakistan and the US with\neach other usually did not fulfil, both were indispensable for each other.\n\"We have to largely depend upon the US for our defence related matters.\n\"India is our main concern as it is buying weapons worth $100 billion from five countries, including China, and to balance\nit our relations with the US are very significant,\" he said and added that India had 5,500 tanks and there was a question\nagainst whom they would be used. \"We cannot be assured by statements that India will not wage a war against us.\"\nGiving a reason as to why Pakistan had to look towards the US for enhancing its military capacity and capability, Mr\nHaqqani said the European countries did not offer soft terms for buying weapons. \"Ties with the US are important for a\nsecure, stable and prosperous Pakistan.\"\nMr Haqqani said Pakistan had also made it clear on the US that it should ensure a strengthened and Islamabad-friendly\nregime in Kabul before leaving.\nHe said Pakistan had sought drone technology from America. \"On one hand our innocent people are losing their lives\nwhile on the other Taliban leaders like Baitullah Mehsud get killed in such attacks,\" he said.\nMr Haqqani said the US wanted to strengthen democracy in Pakistan and aid under the Kerry-Lugar Bill had started\ncoming from January.\nIn reply to a question, he said Pakistan's embassy in the US was working on diplomatic and legal aspects in Dr Aafia\nSiddiqui case and was making efforts for securing her release or transfer of her case to a Pakistani court.\nSECOND STORY\nNo nuclear deal with Pakistan, says US\nBy Anwar lqbal\nMonday, 01 Mar, 2010 I 07:15 AM PST I\nWASHINGTON: The Obama administration has told Pakistan it would not get an atomic power plant or a civilian nuclear\ndeal from the United States.\nA senior US official, while briefing Indian journalists in Washington, said the United States was working closely with\nPakistan to help meet its growing energy needs.\n\"But nuclear power is not currently part of our discussions,\" and the United States had conveyed its decision to Pakistan,\nthe official said.\nHe said the administration had also told Pakistan that \"there is no way they can get a civilian nuclear deal similar to the\none the Obama administration has signed with India\".\nThe lndo-US civilian nuclear deal, the official said, was \"specific to India only and there is no thinking going on in the\nadministration to create a template for it.\"", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Dawn", "type": "source"},

She briefly left Boehner's side in 1998 after he lost the conference post following a\ntough election for Republicans but rejoined him in 2001 when he assumed the\nchairmanship of the Education and Labor Committee.\nAlong the way, she counseled Boehner on just about every decision he made and often\nserved as an enforcer of sorts for the collegial Republican leader.

Boehner, was found dead Jan. 10 at\nher home in Alexandria.\nNo official cause of death was available. Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Boehner (R-Ohio), said it\nappeared that Ms. Nowakowski died of a heart attack.\nA longtime Hill aide, and Boehner's staff chief since 2006, Ms. Nowakowski was named by the Capitol Hill\npublication Roll Call to its 2009 list of the \"Fabulous Fifty\" staff members. The accolade recognized her savvy,\nher clout and her access to the top people in Congress.\nMs. Nowakowski, an avowed conservative, was highly regarded by leaders of both parties.\nShe was praised by Boehner and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\"It is with profound sadness and shock that I announce the passing of Paula Nowakowski, my longtime chief of\nstaff, trusted aide, and friend, who died suddenly,\" Boehner said in a statement.\n\"Words cannot adequately express the sorrow and disbelief I and every member of our team are grappling with\ntoday in the wake of this stunning news,\" Boehner said.\nPelosi called Ms. Nowakowski a \"thorough professional who loved the House and worked in a constructive and\nbipartisan fashion to implement policies to help the Congress function efficiently.\"\nAccording to WhoRunsGov. corn, a Washington Post Co. Web site, Ms. Nowakowski grew up in St. Clair\nShores, Mich., and studied English at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.\nShe told Politico of being made more conservative by the campus \"rise of the loony left,\" citing \"wacky, wacky\nstuff,\" which shaped her politics.\nAccording to a reference book on congressional aides, she worked for the Republican National Committee in\nthe late 1980s and early 1990s, then joined the staff of the House Republican Conference. After two years as a\npublic affairs vice president of the American Insurance Association, she worked from 2001 to 2006 as staff\ndirector of the House Committee on Education & the Workforce. A Boehner aide said she worked for him at\nboth the Republican Conference and the Education Committee.\nPelosi's staff chief, John Lawrence, who was Ms. Nowakowski's Democratic counterpart on the education\ncommittee, said they transcended political differences to \"work in a very collegial way to strengthen the House\nitself.\" He called her \"a great professional.\"\nAfter the GOP lost its House majority in 2006 , Ms. Nowakowski said she experienced \"the seven stages of\ngrief,\" according to the Almanac of the Unelected 2008, a reference on Hill staffers.\n\"You don't want to be a compliant minority,\" she said of the party's new status, \"but you have to adjust your\nexpectations.\"\nIn his statement, Boehner called Ms. Nowakowski \"a tireless worker, faithful friend and rabid Detroit sports\nfan.\nSurvivors include her longtime companion, Michael Smith, her mother, a brother and a sister.\nC 2010 The Washington Post Company", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Paula Nowakowski",

SID", "prompt": "March 15, 2010\nOp-Ed Columnist\nTaking On China\nBy PAUL KRUGMAN\nTensions are rising over Chinese economic policy, and rightly so: China's policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi,\nundervalued has become a significant drag on global economic recovery. Something must be done.\nTo give you a sense of the problem: Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency \u2014 selling renminbi\nand buying foreign currencies, so as to keep the renminbi weak and China's exports artificially competitive \u2014 began\naround 2003. At that point China was adding about $10 billion a month to its reserves, and in 2003 it ran an overall\nsurplus on its current account \u2014 a broad measure of the trade balance \u2014 of $46 billion.\nToday, China is adding more than $30 billion a month to its $2.4 trillion hoard of reserves. The International Monetary\nFund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $450 billion \u2014 10 times the 2003 figure. This is the most\ndistortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed.\nAnd it's a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world. Most of the world's large economies are stuck in a liquidity\ntrap \u2014 deeply depressed, but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates are\nalready near zero. China, by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus, is in effect imposing an anti-stimulus on these\neconomies, which they can't offset.\nSo how should we respond? First of all, the U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating.\nTwice a year, by law, Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that \"manipulate the rate of exchange between their\ncurrency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining\nunfair competitive advantage in international trade.\" The law's intent is clear: the report should be a factual determination,\nnot a policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwilling\nto do what the law requires, namely explain to Congress why it isn't taking action. Instead, it has spent the past six or\nseven years pretending not to see the obvious.\nWill the next report, due April 15, continue this tradition? Stay tuned.\nIf Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation, then what? Here, we have to get past a common misunderstanding:\nthe view that the Chinese have us over a barrel, because we don't dare provoke China into dumping its dollar assets.\nWhat you have to ask is, What would happen if China tried to sell a large share of its U.S. assets? Would interest rates\nsoar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldn't change: they're being kept near zero by the Fed, which won't raise rates\nuntil the unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, but they're mainly determined by market\nexpectations of future short-term rates. Also, the Fed could offset any interest-rate impact of a Chinese pullback by\nexpanding its own purchases of long-term bonds.\nIt's true that if China dumped its U.S. assets the value of the dollar would fall against other major currencies, such as the\neuro. But that would be a good thing for the United States, since it would make our goods more competitive and reduce\nour trade deficit. On the other hand, it would be a bad thing for China, which would suffer large losses on its dollar\nholdings. In short, right now America has China over a barrel, not the other way around.\nSo we have no reason to fear China. But what should we do?\nSome still argue that we must reason gently with China, not confront it. But we've been reasoning with China for years, as\nits surplus ballooned, and gotten nowhere: on Sunday Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, declared \u2014 absurdly \u2014\nthat his nation's currency is not undervalued. (The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the\nrenminbi is undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen accused other nations of doing what China actually\ndoes, seeking to weaken their currencies \"just for the purposes of increasing their own exports.\"\nBut if sweet reason won't work, what's the alternative? In 1971 the United States dealt with a similar but much less severe\nproblem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports, which was removed a few\nmonths later after Germany, Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies. At this point, it's hard to\nsee China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action \u2014 except that this time the surcharge would\nhave to be much larger, say 25 percent.\nI don't propose this turn to policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the world's economic\nproblems at a time when those problems are already very severe. It's time to take a stand.\nHome\n\u2022 World\n\u2022 U.S.\n\u2022 N.Y. / Region\n\u2022 Business\n\u2022 Technology\n\u2022 Science\n\u2022 Health\n\u2022 Sports\n\u2022 Opinion\n\u2022 Arts\n\u2022

Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed, or not bothered, to warn\nthe UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal.\nA Tory source said: \"David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and\ncriminal justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details are\nfor the parties in the executive, working as a four-party coalition, to decide. We hope that between now and\nTuesday any outstanding issues can be solved.\"\nThe Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the\nlargest party in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalist\nand Unionist communities and 50% of the assembly.\nSir Reg Empey, the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement, will meet his\nparty's executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.\nThe deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assembly\nmembers account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc.

Empey, the\nminister for employment and learning, said: \"We exercise our rights, refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which\nwe have been subjected in recent weeks.\"\nThe UUP hit out after facing intense pressure from London and the US to fall in behind David Cameron, who has backed\ndevolution of the criminal justice system. Gordon Brown phoned Empey shortly before today's vote, while former US\npresident George Bush pleaded with Cameron last week to persuade the UUP to support the deal.\nEmpey's unionist rivals, the DUP, who have overtaken the UUP in recent years, focused on what could happen after the\nvote. The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, who managed to persuade all but one of his 36 assembly members to back the\ndevolution deal, said: \"The move is about completing and maintaining devolution, it is about whether we move forward\ntogether as a society.\"\nThe vote secures an extra \u00a3800m for policing and justice that Brown promised the assembly if they backed the transfer. It\nalso adds an extra 1,200 police officers. The prime minister praised the main parties for reaching the deal on an issue that\nalmost broke the power-sharing government.\nHe said: \"Today the politics of progress have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland. The completion of\ndevolution, supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends\nthe most powerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail. The courage\nand leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.\"\nThe vote was also praised tonight by Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state. She\nsaid: \"I commend the Northern Ireland Assembly for its affirmation of the\nHillsborough Agreement and its endorsement of the devolution of policing and\njustice, an important step in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous future for all of the\npeople of Northern Ireland for generations to come.\"\nIrish president Mary McAleese also hailed the move. \"Today's vote in the Northern Ireland assembly represents an\neloquent statement of confidence in the political institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement,\" she said.\nMatt Baggott, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, welcomed the vote as a step forward. \"Devolution\nwill strengthen our service. It will help to ensure communities receive the policing service that not only they deserve, but\nthat we are committed to delivering.\n\"The financial package is also welcomed ... it will help us deal with those who are living in the darkness of the past and\nwho have tried to disrupt this process and the lives of our community.\"\nBut there was discord inside Stormont after the UUP and their 17-strong assembly team voted against the move.\nMartin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's deputy first minister, denounced the UUP stance, claiming they were doing it to\nembarrass the DUP. \"The UUP declared last night [Monday] that they will not support this resolution,\" McGuinness told\nthe assembly. \"That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political\nreasons.\" He stressed that no single party could control the justice department.\nThe UUP no-vote will put pressure on the Tories, who will campaign with their allies in the general election, having taken\nopposing sides on the biggest vote since the DUP and Sinn Fein started sharing power in 2007.\nCameron insisted that the Tories had played a constructive role, saying he would maintain his alliance with the UUP. \"We\nwant to move Northern Ireland politics forward \u2014 to focus on the issues that affect people in their everyday lives \u2014 rather\nthan remaining stuck in the past. That is why we remain totally committed to bringing national, mainstream UK politics to\nNorthern Ireland and to ending its semi-detached political status.\"\nCameron's remarks were designed, in part, to reassure the White House, which fears a UUP no-vote could harden\nunionist opinion against power-sharing.\nHardline Unionists turned on the DUP tonight. Jim Allister, the former DUP MEP, who now leads the breakaway\nTraditional Unionist Voice, claimed his former party had \"rolled over in triple somersaults for Sinn Fein\". He also\nsuggested the new justice minister would be a \"pointless puppet keeping the seat warm for Sinn Fein\". Prior to the vote\nthe widow of the first Police Service of Northern Ireland officer to be murdered by dissident republicans urged all parties to\nback the devolution of policing and justice powers. Kate Carroll, whose husband, Stephen, was killed by a Continuity IRA\nsniper, said in an appeal to the UUP: \"It is heartbreaking that I have to get on this morning to please ask the politicians to\nget on with their job.\"", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "841t;SCRIPT", "type": "script"}, {"id": "JavaScript1.1", "type": "language"}, {"id":

Conference\nBy JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA\nThe U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeks\nto prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday.\nU.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington\u2014criticized by some\nfor its silence about Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal\u2014will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, as\nIran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.\nWashington also reassured Israel it won't foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant\nprogress has been made on Mideast peace.\nThe U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with a\nbang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusal\nto disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability.\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.\nThe U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies have\nbeen pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran's program.\n\"The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party,\" said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. The\nofficial highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.\nThe designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged\nfrom a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995\nagreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been taken\nsince.\nSenior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear\nweapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egypt\nwould resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran and\nTurkey.\n\"We've made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before,\" said the senior\nU.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.\nU.S. officials stressed, however, that they didn't believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in\nArab-Israeli peace talks.\n\"We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikely\nunless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted,\" said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms\ncontrol and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other members\nof the Nonaligned Movement.\nThe diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N.\nconference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-security\nconference in Washington in March due to such concerns.\nAn Israeli official said Friday that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons, but that\n\"it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all the\ncountries in the region.\"\nThe U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obama's calls for a complete freeze in building new\nJewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days that\nties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday that the Mideast peace process will get on track\nnext week, though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administration\nwants to see.\nEgypt's latest proposal calls for Israel's disarmament \"as soon as possible.\" It also called for Israel's nuclear program to be\nplaced under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won't\nbe accepted, U.S. officials said.\nThe Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release \"all information available to them on the nature and\nscope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel.\"\nU.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel.\nArms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task of\ncalling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone.\n\"They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections,\" said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-Proliferation\nEducation Center and a critic of the Obama administration's arms-control approach.\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group, said the U.S. acceptance of a\nspecial envoy is a significant shift.

Richard Lugar, R-IN, \"The crisis should not be used as an excuse to win\nincreases that could not otherwise be justified. As the requests for capital are negotiated with the international donor\ncommunity, there is a window of opportunity for significant reform.\"\nThe report, which is the culmination of six years of research, including half a dozen hearings when Lugar was committee\nchairman, outlines several dozen recommendations for what the Obama administration, Congress, and the banks can do\nto update their relevance.\n\"Does the world really need the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank\nfor Reconstruction and Development, and Inter-American Development Bank today? Can they be changed to better\naddress our needs? How should we re-design them?\" the report asks.\n\"Such questions are particularly timely because nearly all the IFIs have sought, or will soon seek, major new infusions of\nmoney from their donors, including the taxpayers of the United States.\"\nThe Asian Development Bank has already asked the Obama administration for new funds, and the administration has\nrequested in its new budget $533 million in direct money and $12.8 billion in borrowing authority for the ADB.\nA committee staffer told The Cable that Lugar wants to see progress on reform before he would support authorizing the\nmoney.\n\"We want to make sure that before the American taxpayer puts more money in there that things are fixed,\" the staffer\nsaid. \"It's not possible for them to do everything, but they could certainly make progress.\"\nThe reforms the administration could press for in the short term include pressing the banks to focus more on\ndevelopment goals rather than the structure and size of loans and \"work with the other donor countries to step back\nand slow down the process,\" the staffer said.\nCongress is also concerned that the Obama administration might not be interested in pressing for these reforms,\nconsidering that Obama issued a signing statement in June indicating he did not feel bound to follow congressional\ndirection on such international negotiations.\nNegotiations between several banks and the Treasury Department are ongoing. The U.S. side is led by Scott Morris,\ndeputy assistant secretary of the Treasury's Office of International Development Finance and Debt.\nThe issue will next surface at the end of March when the Inter-American Development Bank convenes its annual\nmeeting in Cancun.\nMichael H.

He also worked for Clinton Admn and helped with disaster relief (including earthquakes)\naround the world. He called me today with some suggestions (some of which may be moot), so I asked him to put them\ninto a memo. Here it is, for what it's worth:\nI think the fundamental issue is that no one seems to be in charge and no\none person has been tasked with trying to pull all of the pieces together\ninto a short term and long term plan. Obviously in the short term, search\nand rescue and food and water are the main priorities. There seems to be\nlittle communication between the various areas where people have congregated\nand a central command post where agencies can call or radio for additional\nsupplies including food, water and medical.\nI don't recommend DoD be put in charge of this. They rarely have the kind of\ntouch that brings together all the necessary agencies under one roof. I\nwould set up a central command that has representatives from all federal\nagencies in one place. There is no reason things should be this\ndisorganized. I would break the island into grids and assign one person to\nbe the coordinator for each of the grids. That person will be responsible\nfor all activities within their grid and will report activities to the\nisland on-scene coordinator. We should get a radio company like Motorola to\nset up temporary towers and give the State Department several hundred radios\nso everyone involved in the response is able to communicate with the command\npost and with each other.\nI think one of the most important roles for DoD is to provide security for\nthe rescue teams and medical teams. They also should be responsible for the\noperation of the airport, for off loading planes and for scheduling all\nincoming flights so there is no lost time waiting for planes to land. I also\nthink DoD should be responsible for airlifting supplies that are requested\nby each one of the grid coordinators. Additionally, the helicopters should\nbe used to move critical patients to the hospital ship on the way and to the\naircraft carrier currently on station. At least once a day, the coordinator\nassigned by the President and the Secretary of State should be responsible\nfor getting situation reports from all agencies on site, particularly\nregarding food and water, security, medical and search and rescue.\nThe lack of command and control is allowing the situation to become more\nchaotic rather than more coordinated. I believe that if the Secretary were\nto talk to the other nations involved through the UN, they would be\nsupportive of better coordination.\nBottom line is that there is no order to the operation and you need strong\npeople in there who can speak on behalf of the President and the Secretary\nand get things under control quickly.\nI hope this is helpful. If you or the Secretary have any questions please\nfeel free to call me on my cell We leave for Tokyo at 7:15 am\ntomorrow and transfer to a United flight due back in DC at 2:30 pm tomorrow.\nPlease give the Secretary my best regards. I hope to see you soon.\nB6", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Jerry", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Guiliani", "type": "person"}, {"id": "NYC", "type": "location"}, {"id": "B6", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Clinton Admn", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "disaster relief", "type": "activity"}, {"id": "earthquakes", "type": "event"}, {"id": "memo", "type": "document"}, {"id": "fundamental issue", "type": "problem"}, {"id": "short term", "type": "time_period"}, {"id": "long term", "type": "time_period"}, {"id": "search and rescue", "type": "activity"}, {"id": "food and water", "type": "resource"}, {"id": "communication", "type": "activity"}, {"id": "central command post", "type": "location"}, {"id": "agencies", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "DoD", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "touch", "type": "quality"}, {"id": "federal agencies", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "disorganization", "type": "problem"}, {"id": "island", "type": "location"}, {"id": "grids", "type": "location"}, {"id": "coordinator", "type": "role"}, {"id": "radio company", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Motorola", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "State Department", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "security", "type": "activity"}, {"id": "rescue teams", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "medical teams", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "airport", "type": "location"}, {"id": "planes", "type": "vehicle"}, {"id": "helicopters", "type": "vehicle"}, {"id": "hospital ship", "type": "location"}, {"id": "aircraft carrier", "type": "vehicle"}, {"id": "President", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Secretary of State", "type": "person"}, {"id": "situation reports", "type": "document"}, {"id": "command and control", "type": "activity"}, {"id": "chaotic", "type": "quality"}, {"id": "UN", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "order", "type": "quality"}, {"id": "operation", "type": "activity"}, {"id": "strong people", "type": "person"}, {"id": "cell", "type": "device"}, {"id": "Tokyo", "type": "location"}, {"id": "United flight", "type": "vehicle"}, {"id": "DC", "type": "location"}], "edges": [{"source": "Jerry", "target": "Guiliani", "label": "associate"}, {"source": "Jerry", "target": "NYC", "label": "work_location"}, {"source": "Jerry", "target": "B6", "label": "work_location"}, {"source": "Jerry", "target": "Clinton Admn", "label": "work_location"}, {"source": "Jerry", "target": "disaster relief", "label": "involved_in"}, {"source": "disaster relief", "target": "earthquakes", "label": "involved_in"}, {"source": "Jerry", "target": "memo", "label": "author"}, {"source": "fundamental issue", "target": "communication", "label": "cause_of"}, {"source": "fundamental issue", "target": "disorganization", "label": "cause_of"}, {"source": "fundamental issue", "target": "command and control", "label": "cause_of"}, {"source": "fundamental issue", "target": "order", "label": "lack_of"}, {"source": "DoD", "target": "touch", "label": "lack_of"}, {"source": "DoD", "target": "security", "label": "responsible_for"}, {"source": "DoD", "target": "airport", "label": "responsible_for"}, {"source": "DoD", "target": "planes", "label": "responsible_for"}, {"source": "DoD", "target": "helicopters", "label": "responsible_for"}, {"source": "DoD", "target": "President", "label": "report_to"}, {"source": "DoD", "target": "Secretary of State", "label": "report_to"}, {"source": "DoD", "target": "situation reports", "label": "responsible_for"}, {"source": "command and control", "target": "chaotic", "label": "allowing"}, {"source": "Secretary", "target": "UN", "label": "communicate_with"}, {"source": "strong people", "target": "President", "label": "speak_on_behalf_of"}, {"source": "strong people", "target": "Secretary", "label": "speak_on_behalf_of"}, {"source": "cell", "target": "Tokyo", "label": "travel_to"}, {"source": "Tokyo", "target": "United flight", "label": "transfer_to"}, {"source": "United flight", "target": "DC", "label": "travel_to"}]}, "From": "Muscatine, Lissa", "Date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2010 10:46 AM"}, {"id": "C05768939", "title": "FRENCH COMMUNIQUE RE: U.S. ROLE IN HAITI", "prompt": "FYI below on French statement on Haiti and U.S. support:\nParis, January 19, 2010\nCOMMUNIQUE\nDuring their telephone conversation last week, the President of the Republic and President Obama expressed the\nresolute commitment of our two countries in Haiti, and decided to combine their efforts in order to deal with the urgent\nhumanitarian situation and to respond, in the future, to the enormous reconstruction requirements.\nThe French authorities have, since then, been entirely satisfied with the cooperation between our two countries and,\nbeyond that, the continuous coordination between the Crises Centers of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs\nand the U.S. Department of State.

The MPs conclude that British prime ministers have to\nlearn to be less deferential to US presidents and be \"willing to say no\" to America.\nThe report, entitled Global Security: UK-US Relations, says Britain's relationship with America is \"extremely close and\nvaluable\" in a number of areas, particularly intelligence co-operation. However, it adds that the use of the phrase special\nrelationship, in its historical sense, \"is potentially misleading and we recommend that its use should be avoided\".\nIt does not reflect the \"ever-evolving\" relationship between the two countries and raises unrealistic expectations, the MPs\nsay.\n\"Over the longer term, the UK is unlikely to be able to influence the US to the extent it has in the past,\" the committee\nadds.\nIn an apparent rebuke to Tony Blair and his relationship with President George W Bush, the report says there are \"many\nlessons\" to be learnt from Britain's political approach towards the US over Iraq.\n\"The perception that the British government was a subservient poodle to the US administration is widespread both among\nthe British public and overseas,\" the MPs say. \"This perception, whatever its relation to reality, is deeply damaging to the\nreputation and interests of the UK.\"\nWhile the relationship between the American president and the British prime minister was an important part of dealings\nbetween the two countries, the cabinet and parliament also had a role to play. \"The UK needs to be less deferential and\nmore willing to say no to the US on those issues where the two countries' interests and values diverge,\" the MPs say.\nThey are also critical of the US use of extraordinary rendition and torture. The report calls for a comprehensive review of\nthe use by the CIA of British bases, such as that on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, to carry out extraordinary\nrendition.\n\"The issues relating to rendition through Diego Garcia to which we have previously drawn attention raise disturbing\nquestions about the uses to which US bases on British territory are put\", the MPs say.\nThey express regret at \"considerable restraints\" on the ability of both the government and parliament to scrutinise US\nactivities carried out on British territory.\n\"We recommend that the government should establish a comprehensive review of the current arrangements governing\nUS military use of facilities within the UK and in British overseas territories.\" The review should \"identify shortcomings in\nthe current system of scrutiny and oversight ... and report to parliament on proposals to remedy these\".\nThe report also demands a statement from the government on the implications of the Court of Appeal judgment regarding\nthe alleged collusion of MI5 in the torture of Binyam Mohamed, a British resident.\nLast month the court ordered the government to release evidence from American intelligence reports which showed that\nMI5 was aware of the torture.\nSenior US officials subsequently suggested that releasing such evidence might prevent the US from sharing some\nintelligence with Britain.\nContact our advertising team for advertising and sponsorship in Times Online, The Times and The Sunday Times, or\nplace your advertisement.\nTimes Online Services: Dating I Jobs I Property Search I Used Cars I Holidays I Births lvlarriages, Deaths I\nSubscrlptions I E-paper\nNews International associated websites: Milkround\nCopyright 2010 Times Newspapers Ltd.\nThis service is provided on Times Newspapers' standard Terms and Conditions.

The Quartet\nreiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons\nsmuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the\nreunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of\nhumanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council\nresolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and\ninternational donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of\nthe Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.\nConsistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as\nconsulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in\nGaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet\nnotes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the\neffectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards\nmeeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and\ninfrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work\nwith Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as\nquickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in\nconsultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will\nactively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and\npromote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.\nThe Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local\nnon-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully\nenable this work.\nThe Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes\nefforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The\nQuartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and\nammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their\ncargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for\nunnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.\nThe Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his\ncapture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.\nThe Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct\nbilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these\nnegotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation\nwhich began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the\nWest Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id":

Indeed,\nAshton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministers\nmeet -- the ultimate integrated frame.

V5-\nrvi,-\n,\n,\nc.:! (by which I mean today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court\nruline\n;that removes limits from direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today that\nwill have big ripple effects. i mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about \"Internet Freedom,\" mentioned\n;:lere and with a prelude discussion\nI'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, lette, or\nwatching the official video, .'tere. And for now some of the main points while listening (and noting main points down in real\ntime with the handy '\nuiveaSccibe, pen.)\n- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when\nmany people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together, Clinton\nstarted off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and is already\nbeing used in both helpful and destructive ways:\n\"Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not\nan unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political\nrights. Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize\na city or destroy it, modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for\ngood or for ill. The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to\nspew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And technologies with the potential to open up\naccess to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent\nand deny human rights.\"\nAnd a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:\n\"On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the\nUnited States does.\"\n- Underscoring the \"this is a big deal\" tone of the speech, she enumerated the \"Four Freedoms\" that FDR proclaimed in\n1941, as part of the struggle for the world's future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the\nInternet age. Check out the speech yourself for details.\n- The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I\nexpected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an\nitemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:\n\"In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and\nUzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social\nnetworking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were\ndetained.\"\nTunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent\nsense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;\novertaking japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations.., all that is one thing.\nBracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-\ndeal SecState addresses by accident.\nOther passages to the same effect:\n\"As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from\nthe records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....\n\"Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy,\nour government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face\nconsequences and international condemnation....\"\nAnd then the Google section itself.\nI had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main\nargument forleavina it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find a\n\"il\nlvineyiftaiv_in\" acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, its not necessarily a help\nto have the U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant:\nas a proxy for China's own ability to H.to,tentiai and sustain its economic rise:\n\"To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an\nenvironment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If\ncorporate decision makers don't have access to global sources of news and information, investors will\nhave less confidence in their decisions over the long term. Countries that censor news and information\nmust recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is no distinction between censoring political\nspeech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied access to either type of\ninformation, it will inevitably impact on growth.\n\"Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater\nconsideration in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay\nclose attention to this trend. The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of\ninterest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that\nled Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be\ntransparent.\n\"The Internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are\nso many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the\nbasic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the\nUnited States and China have different views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences\ncandidly and consistently in the context of our positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.\"\nThere's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.\nBack to the to-do list for me now.\nPeirmalink\n.Share This", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Jim Fellows", "type": "person"}, {"id": "speech", "type": "event"}, {"id": "China", "type": "country"}, {"id": "The Atlantic website", "type": "website"}, {"id": "Hillary Clinton", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Internet freedom speech", "type": "event"}, {"id": "21 Jan 2010 04:12 pm", "type": "date"}, {"id": "information technology", "type": "technology"}, {"id": "steel", "type": "material"}, {"id": "machine guns", "type": "weapon"}, {"id": "nuclear power", "type": "energy"}, {"id": "information networks", "type": "technology"}, {"id": "al-Qaida", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "government", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "human rights", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "Four Freedoms", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "FDR", "type": "person"}, {"id": "China surprise", "type": "event"}, {"id": "Tunisia", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Uzbekistan", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Vietnam", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Egypt", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Google", "type": "company"}, {"id": "Tunisia", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Vietnam", "type": "country"}, {"id": "U.S. companies", "type": "company"}], "edges": [{"source": "Jim Fellows", "target": "speech", "label": "attended"}, {"source": "Jim Fellows", "target": "China", "label": "returned_from"}, {"source": "Jim Fellows", "target": "The Atlantic website", "label": "posted_on"}, {"source": "Hillary Clinton", "target": "Internet freedom speech", "label": "delivered"}, {"source": "Internet freedom speech", "target": "21 Jan 2010 04:12 pm", "label": "published_on"}, {"source": "information technology", "target": "steel", "label": "can_be_used_for"}, {"source": "information technology", "target": "machine guns", "label": "can_be_used_for"}, {"source": "information technology", "target": "nuclear power", "label": "can_be_used_for"}, {"source": "information networks", "target": "al-Qaida", "label": "enables"}, {"source": "information networks", "target": "government", "label": "enables"}, {"source": "information networks", "target": "human rights", "label": "enables"}, {"source": "FDR", "target": "Four Freedoms", "label": "proclaimed"}, {"source": "China surprise", "target": "Tunisia", "label": "suppressed_in"}, {"source": "China surprise", "target": "Uzbekistan", "label": "suppressed_in"}, {"source": "China surprise", "target": "Vietnam", "label": "suppressed_in"}, {"source": "China surprise", "target": "Egypt", "label": "suppressed_in"}, {"source": "Google", "target": "Tunisia", "label": "operates_in"}, {"source": "Google", "target": "Vietnam", "label": "operates_in"}, {"source": "Google", "target": "U.S. companies", "label": "attracted_interest"}]}, "From": "sbwhoeop", "Date": "Thursday, January 21, 2010 10:20 PM"}, {"id": "C05769302", "title": "COMMENCEMENTS", "prompt": "Exactly -- in case you wanted to factor any into May/June planning.\nLona Valmoro\nt to the Secretary of State\n(direct) B6", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "May", "type": "month"}, {"id": "June", "type": "month"}, {"id": "Lona Valmoro", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Secretary of State", "type": "position"}, {"id": "B6", "type": "communication_channel"}], "edges": [{"source": "May", "target": "June", "label": "successive_month"}, {"source": "Lona Valmoro", "target": "Secretary of State", "label": "report_to"}, {"source": "Lona Valmoro", "target": "B6", "label": "use"}]}, "From": "Valmoro, Lona J", "Date": "Friday, January 22, 2010 7:54 AM"}, {"id": "C05769313", "title": "NEWS REPORT ON MISSING KIDS IN HAITI", "prompt": "This is an AFP report from today.\nAlso, GTIP is working on a memo for you and Cheryl about child trafficking dangers in Haiti.\nTrafficking fears as Haiti children go missing\nPosted 5 hours 47 minutes ago\nUpdated 5 hours 46 minutes ago\nSlideshow: Photo 1 of 2\nThe UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster.

Federal Elections Commission, the landmark case that\nallows corporations and unions to spend limitless amounts of money on presidential and congressional political\ncampaigns. A majority of large businesses are now owned by foreign entities, and this means international corporations\ncould pour tons of money into the United States political scene, potentially swaying the political climate.\nThe biggest questions with this ruling is the scope of the term \"corporation,\" says Edward Foley, law professor at the Ohio\nState University College of Law and director of the election-law program. Does the high court want this decision to apply\nto foreign corporations as well as domestic ones, he ponders? The truth is, the court didn't make a decision one way or\nthe other.\nFoley best explains the potential issues by talking about the electronic, video, and communication giant, Sony. The\ncorporation is headquartered in Japan, but a large number of its shareholders reside in the United States. In fact, people\ncan even buy and trade Sony's stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The issue is whether this corporation, with strong\nties to a foreign country and the United States, should be permitted to independently contribute money to presidential and\ncongressional campaigns.\nThe court sought to expand First Amendment protection for corporations, but did it really mean to promote the free flow of\nideas from Russian or Chinese corporations, Foley asks? Justice John Pau! Stevens focused on the same concerns in his\ndissenting opinion. The majority's position \"would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations\ncontrolled by foreigners as to individual Americans,\" he writes.\nThis afternoon, President Obama asked Congress to \"develop a forceful response\" to the ruling. But with Congress\njuggling so many other important issues, it's unlikely that a change will be made in the immediate future. This could mean\nthat foreign cash could be supporting political candidates in next year's congressional midterm elections.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Citizens United v.

The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees,\nand immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated\nresponse. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by\na more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth\nsector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with\nconsiderable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR was\nconsultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR was\npresented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami.\n2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set to\nsix months, but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase is to run for\nabout 21 months, through December 2006, and the Reconstruction phase from July 2006 through\nDecember 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions.\n3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency\ninfrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The Rehabilitation phase is to restore\nservices to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma\ntreatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction is to rebuild\nthe region: rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation,\ntelecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing.\n4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself, the\nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR was formally established end April\n2005 and became operational early May. The World Bank Board on 30 March 2005 formally established\nthe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR, GOI, donors and civil\nsociety. Having a credible local coordinators was key to success.\n5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF, while only 2.5% of USD 400 million from the\nUS goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to begin\nwith even slower. By October 2005, project agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed, but\nonly USD 3 million had actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delay\nwas caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all the\nexact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding\nformal agreements, and accept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of\nslightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval and\nimplementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be\nimplemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.\n6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not have\nown capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assume\nfiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that\nthe funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid-\nfor administrative services. However, the all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large and\nto some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues.\n7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk\nshows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as\nwell as a telephone hotline.\n8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue. The MDF is thus\nan entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact.\n9. Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions \u2014 though it does allow for\npreference indications \u2014 it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the\ncriteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, the MDF is seen as the\nmost successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been\ncriticized for a lack of coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the\nMDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness\nand efficiency of the reconstruction effort.\n10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy.\nThe MDF lacked executive rights, but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Government of Indonesia (GOI)", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Pierre Louis", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund", "type":

Gelb\nJuly 7, 2010 I 2:38pm\nI ri==IPresident Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval\nOffice of the White House, July 6, 2010. (Gary Fabiano / Sipa Press) Obama's bow to Netanyahu was\njust the latest in a series of disastrous missteps in U.S. policy toward Israel. Leslie H. Gelb on who's to\nblame\u2014and how the White House can get back on course.\nWhoever advised President Obama to flay Israel publicly until this week should be fired. Only advisers with no experience\nin dealing with Israel could have believed that Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Netanyahu would bow to public attacks.\nAnd whoever advised Mr. Obama to kneel rhetorically to Mr. Netanyahu in public on Tuesday should also be fired. The\nonly thing accomplished by this embarrassing tactic was to put Israel in a position to call the shots on Mideast policy for\nthe rest of Obama's first term.\nThe real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it's failure.\nWere the culprits the non-foreign policy White House intimates \u2014 chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and political honcho David\nAxelrod? Axelrod knows nothing about this, and worse, Emanuel thinks he does because he lived in Israel. Was George\nMitchell, the president's Mideast negotiator, the brains behind the foolishness? Surely, he's had enough experience\nworking with Israelis to know better. Did General James Jones, the National Security Adviser, remain silent, again? And of\ncourse, where was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Strangely for someone so adept at pleasing Israel's constituents in\nAmerica, she spent a lot of time this past year publicly beating up on Israeli leaders. Has she been led astray by the pro-\nArab contingent of the State Department?\n\u2022Martin Indyk: New Hope for Mideast Peace\n\u2022Peter Beinart: Netanyahu's Latest Insult Or is the guilty party none other than President Obama himself? The more we\nfind out about who makes decisions in the White House on every subject from nuclear weapons to coloring of Easter\neggs, it turns out to be the man in the Oval Office himself. He's the expert. He's the decider. He invites everyone to state\nhis or her piece or peace, then he tells them what to do \u2014 and seemingly without question, they do his bidding.\nMr. Obama started his White House tenure from a near-zero base of foreign policy knowledge and no experience in the\nMiddle East. It was easy enough to guess this blissful state from his earliest decisions. He came out of the box demanding\nthat Israel agree to suspend construction on the West Bank as a precondition for direct negotiations with the Palestinians.\nAnyone who knew anything about this situation surely would have told the president that the chances of Mr. Netanyahu\nagreeing to this \"proposal\" were zero, or minus zero. No Israeli leader, even a dovish one, would ever dream of beginning\nnegotiations by conceding his major bargaining card. As the teenagers say, what were Obama and his advisers thinking?\nAnd yes, after the Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden during his trip to the Holy Land by announcing they\nwould start new construction in East Jerusalem, Washington had to respond vehemently. The Israelis had been arrogant\nand stupid on this one. They had weakened American power in the region. No U.S. president could let them get away with\nit. Clinton and others made strong public statements of criticism, and those were fine. But Mr. Obama then allowed Mr.\nNetanyahu to come ahead with his planned visit to D.C. \u2014 and publicly humiliated him. The U.S. president let the Israeli\nprime minister cool his heels for hours before meeting with him, then wouldn't shake his hand when he departed. There's\nno surer way to unite a nation behind its leader, even a controversial one like Netanyahu, than to have a foreign leader\nhumiliate him.\nThis brilliant tactic \u2014 thought of by Obama's advisers or the president himself \u2014 accomplished two things. It stiffened Israeli\nbacks even further against being conciliatory about starting talks with the Palestinians. The Israeli government was not\nabout to cave to American pressures. It also galvanized Israeli supporters in the United States \u2014 in particular within\nconservative parts of the Jewish community and the Republican Party. There went Mr. Obama's support for pressing\nIsrael even in private.\nTo top this all off with Tuesday's meeting, full of smiles and the adoption of Israeli-desired language on almost every topic,\nonly made matters worse. It made the situation look as if the American president had been cowed by Jewish control of\n. .\nAmerican politics. That certainly pleased American and Israeli hawks, but it did not please others who want to see\ngenuine progress in Mideast talks.\nThere is a time and place for Washington to put pressure on Israel. Mr. Obama and his team picked every wrong time and\nplace. The right occasion to squeeze is when the negotiations have reached the point where both sides have given and\nwhere both must give more to close the deal. Only at that point does pressure make sense. All parties would get a real\nshot at peace in return for their concessions.\nTo be sure, many ask at this point \u2014 How do you get to that point? The answer is not to browbeat the parties to scurry to\nthe negotiating table. That tactic simply never pays off. The answer is to build conditions beyond the negotiating table,\nconditions in the political community in both Israel and Palestine, that would support compromises at the table. The British'\npushed the Catholics and Protestants to make concessions year after year, only to fail time and again, only to further\ninflame feelings all around and spur greater violence. Finally, London focused on getting Protestant and Catholic women\nto form common groups to support compromise. London did as much with various business communities that evolved into\nbackers of mutual concessions as well. Only then did parties know that they had support for compromises, their\nnegotiations got somewhere, and they reached agreement. That's what needs to be done between Israel and the\nPalestinians.\nWe hear time and again that the enemy of peace in the Middle East is time, and that time is running out. Perhaps that is\nwhat has caused Mr. Obama and his team to misstep so badly; they think it's a race against the clock. Do something now\nor fail. But the real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it's failure. Neither Israel nor the\nPalestinians nor the United States can afford to fail again. After yet another failure, it could well result in perpetual\nviolence.\nTo set his Arab-Israeli policy on a sensible course, Mr. Obama needs to search for new advisors who know how to get\nthings done in the Middle East, hire them, and listen to them.\nLeslie H.

For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollars\nprovided by the USG. The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment, the first in\n2003 for $10 million, the second in 2008 for $3 million. Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors to\nthe AUCA president on accreditation and development, support for the journalism faculty, and scholarship funds for\nstudents from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan to attend the university.\nSoros has proposed that the USG increase this support, offering a 1-1 match of $10 million each from State and his\nfoundation, totaling $20 million over the next five years. Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros, and they\nhave been discussing the issue with Soros' staff.\nA little bit of additional information from SCA on AUCA: The university has made significant progress this year on a\nnumber of its key objectives and remains a unique institution in Central Asia, a place where students are judged solely\non merit and a forum for free expression and critical thinking. The university achieved an important milestone this year\nrelated to its U.S. accreditation, signing an agreement with Bard College under which AUCA graduates starting next May\nwill receive full diplomas from Bard College, an institution accredited in the United States.

SID", "prompt": "Gaza: it's Hamas's move now\nHamas must seize the initiative if there is ever to be an end to Israel's occupation of Palestine\n\u2022\n\u2022\nc) Jeremy Greenstock\no quardian.co.uk, Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BST\nSo it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of building\nmaterials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong.\nThe UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must be\nheld to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to\nprevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination?\nA commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever the\nemotions behind all this.\nWhy is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for\nthe proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating a\ntraumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. They\nare also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida's ground.\nThe director of UNRWA operations in Gaza, John Ging, gave a speech in London this week entitled \"Illegal, inhuman. and\ninsane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010\". This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. How has Israel,\nthe only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end, come to risk any claim to\ninternational legitimacy in its handling of this situation?\nHamas are the enemy of Israel, but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily, yet over the past\n17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets \u2014 imperfectly\nperhaps, but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gaza\nbombing stopped in January 2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006\nand claim to respect democracy. Let's test them on that. At present, Hamas security people are being sniped at by the\nIsraeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane.\nThe unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine, in both the West\nBank and Gaza, is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation. I am convinced from my own direct\nexperience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without the\nthreat of violence, and that they would enter in good faith, if that were reciprocated, into negotiations to establish two\nstates in the disputed territories, Israel and Palestine, with their own rights and responsibilities under international law.\nThe distortion of their position, a little of it the fault of their own PR, does no side any good.\nIf a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now, what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end the\nblockade is within reach if only Israel, Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. Hamas have indicated that\nthey could cease all attacks on Israeli soil, close the tunnels, release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza if\nthe blockade was ended, an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt.\nThe Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation, while the relationship between Fatah in\nthe West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN, the US, Russia, the EU and the Arab world must make a\nmuch more serious attempt to test the possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first, not their own political\ncomfort.\nWe are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy, based on a West-Bank-only approach, is\nlocked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation, because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel is\nconfident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated.\nBut that ignores the huge danger of losing the political, diplomatic, legal and moral high ground. This matters in today's\nworld, as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq, because government authority and public opinion interact closely, and\nlegitimacy breeds support.\nIsrael's relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyond\nthe west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent occupier, or controlling a one-state structure with part of\nits population downgraded or imprisoned, it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for.\nI hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel's discomfiture.

Lithuania\nhas the lead for the next two years. They are extremely energetic and recognize that CD needs to be reinvigorated. It\nwas not given much leadership from us during the Bush years and besides democracy got a bad name \u2014 among other\nreasons. Their plan is to create a few working groups focused on issues that are current and important with specific\npractical goals and tangible results \u2014 among them, one will be focused on women and their critical role. As you know,\nthey have a female president, the EU has just established a Gender Institute in Vilnius and they remember Vital Voices\nwhen you headed up the conference in Iceland and the successor conference which was held in Lithuania in 2001. We\ntalked about a more concerted commitment -- to advocating for women and the role they need to play in conflict\nresolution (1325), helping women in Afghanistan and working to help women in eastern Europe and the Caucuses where\nthings appear to be going backwards in many ways (takes me back to our first-ever VV conference in Vienna).\nI agreed that we would co-chair the gender working group with Lithuania.\nThe Lithuanians believe that in many ways the younger generation takes for granted what the older generation fought\nfor (they remember being a \"Captive Nation and how the US kept them going with an embassy when they was little\nlikelihood at the time that they'd ever become a democracy), and that today democracies are struggling in too many\nplaces. It's as though we have to take back democracy's good name and focus it as a universal value to address the\ncritical challenges.\nMike Posner has the lead on CD. I talked to him about all of this. He is all for our doing the gender working group as\nsomething tangible. He is concerned about where the Community of Democracies goes more broadly.

Last Thursday Clinton\ndescribed Mother Teresa \"beaming about what this meant for children and their futures,\" seemingly oblivious that the\nMother Teresa Home for Infant Children in northwest Washington, D.C., is now defunct. She said she worked tirelessly\nto \"cut through all the red tape,\" although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing. According to a\npastor at the church next door to the home's former location, the adoption ministry failed to take off because the\nRoman Catholic nuns who ran it weren't allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site. \"I'm not sure the\nlegal thing that came down upon them, but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way,\" said\nMaureen Freshour, who along with her husband, David, pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby. Freshour\nhas stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining\nthree or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington, where they are ministering to the homeless.\"This has\nbeen a core issue\u2014adoption\u2014whether the home [Clinton] talked about survived or not,\" said Chuck Johnson, chief\noperating officer of the National Council for Adoption. \"It's an issue she's been consistent on.\"During her speech on\nThursday, Clinton reminisced about the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and Mother\nTeresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, \"Any country that\naccepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want.\" Mother Teresa then\ncalled on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: \"Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the\nchild.\"The audience that day gave her a standing ovation\u2014but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did not\nstand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage,\nsitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter.\"She told me that she knew that we had a\nshared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies,\" Clinton related last\nThursday. \"And she asked me\u2014or more properly, she directed me\u2014to work with her to create a home for such babies\nhere in Washington.\"Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year,\nno small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa Home for\nInfant Children opened in June 1995 in the district's affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant\nmothers and their babies\u2014but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.I called the Missionaries of Charity\nin Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone said\nshe couldn't give her name because they aren't allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters who\nare in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn't sure why it closed. She\nadded that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. \"We work with the poor and we didn't have any work there\nbecause it's a rich neighborhood,\" she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those with\nAIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street.\n###", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id":

Reuters) content, so here's the long awaited FT\nprofile -you'll be especially interested in the guest column David Milliband wrote:\nAn FT interview with Hillary Clinton\nBy Daniel Dombey\nFT\nJune 11 2010 22:21\nThis is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed\nstreets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that\nhas not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most\nexciting for a generation - had never ended.\nBut this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not\nSouth Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what\nthe overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might\nsuggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of\nUS leadership, one very much built around herself.\nShe's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall\ntonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised\narms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones.\nIn the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays\nthat pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while\nBrazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a\nborn politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and\nlocal celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage.\nMost US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it\nto be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip -\nand she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed\nbodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a\nquarter of a million miles since taking office.\nOn this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four\ncountries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a\nshower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we\ndon't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day.\nSo what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week,\ntalking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out.\n\"We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister\nor the foreign minister or an ambassador,\" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her\nexpansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. \"People now have a voice and an opinion and a\nvote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of\nleadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.\"\nShe argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration\n- by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a\nbattle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is\nideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the\nforeign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions -\ngo beyond that.\nIs she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? \"Well, I think that is part of the job,\" she replies,\ntoying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. \"If you are making a case for American values and\nfor American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we\nhad to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.\"\nAs in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - \"I've been fighting this all day,\" she says as she masks a\ncough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still\nhectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State\nDepartment are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and\nunhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as \"oh my gosh\", even as she discusses issues of\nstate. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's\nbeen talking to Norway's foreign minister about it.\n\"He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how\nelse to describe it,\" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word\n\"chunky\".\nClinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner\nof her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known\nless for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who\nretains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying\nfrom a room.\nHer staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,\nand the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W.\nBush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most\nsubstantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who\nserved as secretary almost a century ago. \"Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential\nstature, has set her apart,\" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. \"Leaders\nwant to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.\"\nState visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo\nairport in March\nBack in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of\ntraditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her\ndance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous\nyoung man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,\nsmiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female\nstudent asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she\nemphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if\ndemonstrating the size of a fish.\nThen a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into\ntreacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just\nexpectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. \"Wealthy women\nhave rights in every country,\" she says. \"And poor women don't.\" Her strength of feeling can't be hidden\nas she denounces \"the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise\nsuch a fundamental personal right\".\nTom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: \"I understand the possible concern that we\nmight have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was\nsharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state.\" It's true: Clinton\ndoesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without\nappearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight\nahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is\nthe lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the\npodium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her\nsatisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the\nstage.\nYet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her \"almost inhuman loyalty\"\ntowards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an \"information carnivore\" one of her officials calls her -\ncomes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the\nforeign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.\nIn Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive\ndiscrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-\nBrazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students.\n\"That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so\nthat they can have a chance to succeed,\" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before\nspeaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She\nsays: \"The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it\ndemonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.\"\nAmong the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome\nstatement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead\nand millions of dollars in the struggle against him.\nThe great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama\nadministration\nWhen I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the\nobedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne \"that's politics\". She adds: \"We're\nworking really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to\nme.\" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. \"I always run\ninclusive and successful organisations,\" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from\nthat searing experience to her new post.\nShe admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the\nSenate -. \"but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do\nsomething, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't.\" Also, she adds: \"Suppose I had won\nand I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.\"\nOthers say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton\nhas moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than\nbefore. \"Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised\nthat,\" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. \"The relationship is\nbased on her performance in the job.\"\nBy all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good\nworking relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an\nalliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is\nGates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been\npopular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -\nas was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.\nIn truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's\nRevolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he\nis to hint at using the military. \"She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,\" says Kurt\nVolker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.\nShe has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of\nIsrael and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.\nMeanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides\nsay they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill\nClinton gives her strategic advice. \"One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a\nkind of baseball saying,\" she says: \"Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines\nbut the trend lines.\"\nIt is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the\nchief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,\nshe replies \"the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying\nand solving problems.\" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.\nBut maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,\nwhen the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable\nare the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but\nneeds instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a\nsmart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had\ntowards her.\n\"It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the\nmost consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,\" says one official. Praising what he\ncalls her \"Terminator-quality durability and determination,\" he adds: \"She's done an amazing amount of\nwork, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.\"\nIndeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She\nhas dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her\nconfirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the\nmeeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She\nherself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her\ncampaign claims of expertise in the field. \"It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around\nall of these issues,\" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the\nway she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze\na few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, \"you may be in a different city\nfour times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your\naudience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global\nchallenges in the course of a day.\"\nAs the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of\ninternational issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of\nimportant countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,\nIndonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She\nsays the push is working, hailing a \"change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the\nUS\" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and\nover Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid\nquestioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies.\nDuring my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the\ncountry's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to\nsecure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her\ncause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign\nminister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces \"an Iran that runs to\nBrazil\" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China \"telling different things to different people to\navoid international sanctions\". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions\non Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. \"Of course, I don't agree\nwith everything the Secretary said,\" he says.\nIt is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the\nUnited Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers\ndescribed his approach to government as a \"permanent campaign\", and it appears to be his wife's\npreferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in\nher cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.\n\"Never, never!\" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the\nfrustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. \"I have a very realistic sense of what high-\nstakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the\narena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,\nbut you can't take it personally.\" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to\ncoverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives.\n\"Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she\ngets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that\nyou bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,\" she says.\nAnother country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica\nInjustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many\nother incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. \"I feel passionately it is in not\njust the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and\nthe tools to make the most out of their own lives,\" she says.\nIn the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she\nsays, \"I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do\nmy job.\" \"It's all baloney,\" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is\nsitting to one side in her office.\n\"Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,\" Clinton responds.\nI wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by\ntalking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will\nonly serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I\nask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: \"I'd love that,\nobviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.\"\n\"Any chance it would be you?\" I ask.\n\"No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,\" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. \"I\nthink that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women\nwho are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to\nrun for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact.\" But, says one US\nofficial, \"all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with\nelectoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea\nbehind raising her domestic profile still further?\"\nIndeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say\nshe could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.\nBack in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The\njourney goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard\nroad. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather\nfewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton,\nlong one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.\nDaniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondent\nDavid Miliband: \"Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour\"\nIt's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is\nlaying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense -\nprobably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is\nessential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and\noverlapping forums - is real and right.\nYou also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers\nmeeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have\nturned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me.\nThat said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her\nhard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great\nsense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself\nas well as at others.\nShe's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks\nstrategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in\na particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a\nnecessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's\nessential to take part.\nThere's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the\npeople she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in\ntrying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why\nso many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.\nDavid Miliband is shadow foreign secretary\nGideon Rachman: \"Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly\nclose\"\nA school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give\nher 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.\nSecretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless\nbureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in\npromoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry\nKissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him\nall the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely\nadmired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which\nlimited his ability to get things done in the wider world.\nHillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so\ndamaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the\ncampaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the\nWhite House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton\nappointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is\nrather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign\ncapitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than\nanyone else to define his administration's approach to the world.\nThat still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have\nbeen appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.\nAsked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and\nsays: \"She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area\nwhere she has really driven policy.\"\nGideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist\nDavid Rothkopf: \"When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly\"\nHillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued\nhis agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with\nother members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.\nThat includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise\nof new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy\nstructure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with\nprivate and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats.\nWhen the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.\nThis has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.\nStill, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the\nmost powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the\nsituation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely\ndifficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of\nemerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.\nWe have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to\none where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to\nwork in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of\nthose things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.\nHillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature\nissues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.\nDavid Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace with expertise in\nnational security", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "FT", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Reuters", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "FT profile", "type": "article"}, {"id": "David Milliband", "type": "person"}, {"id": "FT interview", "type": "article"}, {"id": "Daniel Dombey", "type": "person"}, {"id": "June 11 2010", "type": "date"}, {"id": "22:21", "type": "time"}, {"id": "Hillary Clinton", "type": "person"}, {"id": "2008 US presidential election", "type": "event"}, {"id": "Sao Paulo, Brazil", "type": "location"}, {"id": "South Hampton, New Hampshire", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Latin America", "type": "location"}, {"id": "US", "type": "country"}, {"id": "White House", "type": "location"}, {"id": "town hall meetings", "type": "event"}, {"id": "strategy sessions", "type": "event"}, {"id": "official 727", "type": "vehicle"}, {"id": "Uruguay", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Argentina", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Chile", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Brazil", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Europe", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Norway", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Lincoln Memorial", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Washington", "type": "location"}, {"id": "cherry blossom trees", "type": "plant"}, {"id": "Air Force One", "type": "vehicle"}, {"id": "Bill Burns", "type": "person"}, {"id": "State Department", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Costa Rica", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Nato Foreign Ministers meeting", "type": "event"}, {"id": "Cairo", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Prague", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Tokyo", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Istanbul", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Treasury", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Iran", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Israel", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Gaza", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Brasilia", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Celso Amorim", "type": "person"}, {"id": "United Nations", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "David Miliband", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Gideon Rachman", "type": "person"}, {"id": "David Rothkopf", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Barack Obama", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Henry Kissinger", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Nixon", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Colin Powell", "type": "person"}, {"id": "George W.

He filed this report:\nMinutes after Landon Donovan scored the stunning extra-time goal that won a critical World Cup match against Algeria,\nBill Clinton and several of his aides and friends (including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry\nMcAuliffe) were escorted downstairs to the U.S. team's locker room. The American players roared with pride as the former\npresident (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in.\nAfter a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: \"I'm proud of you\nbecause you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!\"\nMuch posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldn't quite seem to\nbelieve they had done it.\nThe team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them with\na beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarse\nvoice.\nAs Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the players\nchased him out into the hall and handed one of the former president's aides an official ball signed by all the members of\nTeam USA.\nClinton stopped for just a moment to talk with the local press before disappearing in a convoy of flashing lights and sirens.\n\"If it hadn't been the decisive game, even I would have said it should have been a tie,\" he said. \"It was a great game. You\nknow, all great contests become head games at some point -- sports, elections, wars. And they [Team USA] have good\nheads and good hearts.\"", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Wednesday, Jun 23, 2010 14:22 ET", "type": "date"}, {"id": "Bill Clinton", "type": "person"}, {"id": "U.S. soccer team", "type": "sports_team"}, {"id": "Landon Donovan", "type": "person"}, {"id": "World Cup", "type": "sports_event"}, {"id": "Algeria", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Pretoria", "type": "city"}, {"id": "South Africa", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Joe Conason", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Terry McAuliffe", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Democratic National Committee", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Johannesburg", "type": "city"}, {"id": "Nelson Mandela", "type": "person"}], "edges": [{"source": "Wednesday, Jun 23, 2010 14:22 ET", "target": "Bill Clinton", "label": "event_time"}, {"source": "Bill Clinton", "target": "U.S. soccer team", "label": "praise"}, {"source": "Bill Clinton", "target": "Algeria", "label": "opponent"}, {"source": "Bill Clinton", "target": "Pretoria", "label": "location"}, {"source": "Joe Conason", "target": "Bill Clinton", "label": "accompany"}, {"source": "Landon Donovan", "target": "U.S. soccer team", "label": "score_goal"}, {"source": "Landon Donovan", "target": "Algeria", "label": "opponent"}, {"source": "Landon Donovan", "target": "World Cup", "label": "event_participant"}, {"source": "Terry McAuliffe", "target": "Bill Clinton", "label": "accompany"}, {"source": "Bill Clinton", "target": "Johannesburg", "label": "destination"}, {"source": "Bill Clinton", "target": "Nelson Mandela", "label": "meeting"}]}, "From": "sbwhoeop", "Date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2010 9:03 PM"}, {"id": "C05770007", "title": "CONSULAR FEES", "prompt": "Sorry to confirm they are not in.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "they", "type": "pronoun"}, {"id": "confirm", "type": "action_verb"}], "edges": [{"source": "they", "target": "confirm", "label": "negation"}]}, "From": "Lew, Jacob J", "Date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2010 9:47 PM"}, {"id": "C05770008", "title": "CONSULAR FEES", "prompt": "Copying Rich -- I cannot explain.

Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in\nthe war face an uncertain and tricky future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an\nimpatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.\nRichard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the\nambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-\nending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.\nBut privately, at least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a\nhousecleaning, according to senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies\nheavily on civilian support, these people said.\nIn recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might be\nreplaced by\nRyan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeus\nduring the successful Iraq troop increase.\nSuch a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post at\nTexas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront Ambassador\nEikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner \u2014 one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should work\ntogether in war.\nIt also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him\nup as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between President\nHamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.\nPrior to General Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several\nforceful, ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials\nacknowledge that, as one said, \"There are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team.\" But the White\nHouse believes that the current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent.\nStill, the McChrystal blow-up has reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State\nHillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team,\ntwo officials said. She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.\n\"You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at\neverything,\" said a senior State Department official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.\nBe\nGeneral Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation\nhearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke\nand would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.\n\"Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,\" General Petraeus said in an interview. \"We have had, and do\nhave, a very good relationship.\" That role, he said, will now fall to Ambassador Eikenberry.\nAmbassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60,000 additional troops to\nAfghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General Petraeus was the true\narchitect of the plan.\nThe ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in Afghanistan, graduated from\nWest Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at the academy. The two share\na scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador Eikenberry has Master's degrees\nfrom\nHarvard and Stanford.\nWhile they were never assigned together, their careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment\nof Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General\nEikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.\nGeneral Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues, while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down\nrequests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not\nreturn a call for comment.\nFor Mr. Holbrooke, the new landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it\nwas six months ago, when his ouster was the subject of endless Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less\ncentral player:\nJacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped\nshape, while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his\nown allies admit. He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping\nAfghanistan build an economy.\nThese days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies while seeking\nto draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries in\nMadrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to reintegrate\nTaliban fighters into mainstream society.\nMr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders, and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr.\nHolbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's\nnegotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of American interests. For now, though, as evidence of\nGeneral Petraeus's influence, he will do most of the shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad.\nOn his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army\nchief of staff,\nAshfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to\ndeal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials said they trusted him.\nHusain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to understand Pakistan's\nconcerns. \"Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even by those who may\nnot like him,\" Mr. Haqqani said.\nStill, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure\nvideoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said, General Petraeus threw his support behind a\ncostly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban\nstronghold that is the next major American military target.\nMr. Holbrooke and Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "General David H.

As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair\nHouse, the official White House guesthouse, and not at a hotel.\nThat said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in\nthe course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an\nimpasse to direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the\nconstruction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PA\nChairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin direct talks with Israel. For the time being, the forum of seven is\ndivided over this issue.\nRead more of this post", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Maariv", "type": "newspaper"}, {"id": "Netanyahu", "type": "political_leader"}, {"id": "Clinton", "type": "political_leader"}, {"id": "Mitchell", "type": "political_leader"}, {"id": "Obama", "type": "political_leader"}, {"id": "Washington", "type": "location"}, {"id": "US", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Barack Obama", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Binyamin Netanyahu", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Hillary Clinton", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Mitchell", "type": "person"}, {"id": "peace process", "type": "process"}, {"id": "relationship", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "meeting", "type": "event"}, {"id": "crisis", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "media", "type": "entity"}, {"id": "Blair House", "type": "location"}, {"id": "White House", "type": "location"}, {"id": "hotel", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Washington officials", "type": "group"}, {"id": "proximity talks", "type": "process"}, {"id": "direct negotiations", "type": "process"}, {"id": "construction freeze", "type": "process"}, {"id": "Judea and Samaria", "type": "location"}, {"id": "September 26", "type": "date"}, {"id": "PA Chairman Abu Mazen", "type": "person"}, {"id": "forum of seven", "type": "group"}], "edges": [{"source": "Maariv", "target": "Netanyahu", "label": "reported"}, {"source": "Netanyahu", "target": "Clinton", "label": "refused_to_meet"}, {"source": "Netanyahu", "target": "Obama", "label": "scheduled_to_meet"}, {"source": "US", "target": "Obama", "label": "president"}, {"source": "Netanyahu", "target": "Washington", "label": "visit_to"}, {"source": "Netanyahu", "target": "Clinton", "label": "not_scheduled_to_meet"}, {"source": "US", "target": "Washington", "label": "location_of_visit"}, {"source": "US", "target": "Clinton", "label": "Secretary_of_State"}, {"source": "US", "target": "Obama", "label": "important_person"}, {"source": "Washington officials", "target": "waiting_for", "label": "apprehensively"}, {"source": "Netanyahu", "target": "meeting", "label": "address"}, {"source": "proximity talks", "target": "impasse", "label": "at"}, {"source": "Obama", "target": "demand", "label": "construction_freeze_extension"}, {"source": "September 26", "target": "expiration_date_of", "label": "construction_freeze"}, {"source": "forum of seven", "target": "divided_over", "label": "construction_freeze"}]}, "From": "sbwhoeop", "Date": "Thursday, July 1,2010 11:06 AM"}, {"id": "C05770168", "title": "NOON, STATE OF PLAY", "prompt": "Pls keep the updates coming!", "graph": {"nodes": [], "edges": []}, "From": "H", "Date": "Friday, May 7, 2010 9:03 AM"}, {"id": "C05770170", "title": "H: LATEST, AS OF 5:15 PM, LONDON TIME.

The focus of the Panel is appropriately on the future and on preventing such incidents from\nrecurring.

We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who garnered international attention\nfor her verdict of death by stoning. While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoning,\nher fate has been left unclear. We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim Hamidi, an 18-year old charged with\nhomosexuality, faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation. Neither of\ntheir cases have proceeded with the transparency or due process enshrined in Iran's own constitution and their lawyer,\nMohammad Mostafaei, felt that he had no other choice than to flee Iran after he had been questioned by authorities\nand his family members had been detained.\nWe are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right to\nfree expression after the June 2009 elections, including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad Haj Aghaei, and Javad Lan.\nThe United States urges the Iranian government to halt these executions in accordance with its international obligations\nto the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners\nand imprisoned human rights defenders.

S\n14 16, 2010, 11:01 pm\nChomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel\nBy ROBERT MACKEY\nNoam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West\nBank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver a\nlecture.\nAmira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported:\nNo reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridge\nborder crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel.\nChomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on\nMonday.\nA spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and \"officials were\ntrying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter.\"\nIn a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, \"the facts were\ncompletely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding.\" He explained that he was interrogated for\nseveral hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-\nold scholar added:\nI can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation \u2014 he\nwas receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was\nthat the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say \u2014 which puts them into the category of I suppose\nevery other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an\ninvitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past\nbut not this time.\nMr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the\nPalestinian university in Ramallah.\nThe renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in January 2009 and\nhas criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory many times.\nIn an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, \"I objected to the\nfounding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object\nto the United States as a Christian state.\" When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying,\n\"Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew,\" he replied:\nIt is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque. If an Italian\ncriticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?\n\u2022 Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company\n\u2022 Privacy Policy\n\u2022 NYTimes.com 620 Eighth Avenue New York, NY 10018", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Noam Chomsky", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Israel", "type": "country"}, {"id": "West Bank", "type": "region"}, {"id": "Sunday", "type": "date"}, {"id": "Jordan", "type": "country"}, {"id": "lecture", "type": "activity"}, {"id": "Amira Hass", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Haaretz", "type": "newspaper"}, {"id": "Interior Ministry", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Allenby Bridge", "type": "border crossing"}, {"id": "Bir Zeit University", "type": "university"}, {"id": "Monday", "type": "date"}, {"id": "Reuters", "type": "news agency"}, {"id": "Israeli military", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Amman", "type": "city"}, {"id": "Al Jazeera English", "type": "news network"}, {"id": "Palestinian territory", "type": "region"}, {"id": "scholar", "type": "person"}, {"id": "invitation", "type": "activity"}, {"id": "Ramallah", "type": "city"}, {"id": "Gaza", "type": "region"}, {"id": "January 2009", "type": "date"}, {"id": "Deborah Solomon", "type": "person"}, {"id": "The New York Times Magazine", "type": "publication"}, {"id": "Italian", "type": "person"}], "edges": [{"source": "Noam Chomsky", "target": "Israel", "label": "critic_of"}, {"source": "Noam Chomsky", "target": "West Bank", "label": "entry_denied"}, {"source": "Noam Chomsky", "target": "Jordan", "label": "cross_into"}, {"source": "Noam Chomsky", "target": "lecture", "label": "scheduled_to_speak_at"}, {"source": "Amira Hass", "target": "Haaretz", "label": "reporter_at"}, {"source": "Interior Ministry", "target": "Allenby Bridge", "label": "border_crossing_at"}, {"source": "Noam Chomsky", "target": "Bir Zeit University", "label": "scheduled_to_speak_at"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "Reuters", "label": "spokesperson_told"}, {"source": "Interior Ministry", "target": "Israeli military", "label": "clearance_requested_from"}, {"source": "Noam Chomsky", "target": "Amman", "label": "interview_from"}, {"source": "Noam Chomsky", "target": "Al Jazeera English", "label": "interviewed_by"}, {"source": "Noam Chomsky", "target": "Palestinian territory", "label": "entry_denied"}, {"source": "scholar", "target": "invitation", "label": "taking"}, {"source": "Noam Chomsky", "target": "Ramallah", "label": "invited_to_speak_at"}, {"source": "Gaza", "target": "January 2009", "label": "ended_in"}, {"source": "Deborah Solomon", "target": "The New York Times Magazine", "label": "interviewed_by"}, {"source": "Deborah Solomon", "target": "Noam Chomsky", "label": "opposition_to"}, {"source": "Deborah Solomon", "target": "Israel", "label": "opposition_to"}, {"source": "Deborah Solomon", "target": "Italian", "label": "criticized_by"}]}, "From": "sbwhoeop", "Date": "Monday, May 17, 2010 12:14 AM"}, {"id": "C05770578", "title": "POSNER", "prompt": "Yikes.

The Palestinians\nare ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions.\nResolving the snag over terms is crucial, diplomats say.\" Washpost\nThe former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes to address me as \"gloomy gus\" or some such\nthing when I encounter her. Well, stand by for some more gloom.\nThe second Camp David talks failed because Dennis Ross and company placed the\nPalestinian delegation in a position in which a \"solution\" was demanded and expected by the\nAmericans and Israelis on the basis of bargaining during the negotiations themselves.\nThis seemed reasonable at the time to the US and Israeli negotiators. After all, is this not\nwhat one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the dialectic of argument and\npersuasion?\nArabs generally think not. They tend to believe that negotiations are for the purpose of of\narranging the details of outcomes that are understood in advance of the conference itself. For\nthem, anything else is an attempt to win concessions through trickery.\n\"The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means\npreconditions.\"\nHello! What kind of nonsense is this? Have we learned nothing?\nAnd then, there is the \"little\" matter of the non-participation of Hamas. Does the Obama\nAdministration really think that this 600 pound gorilla can be ignored? Is this some sort of\nscheme on the part of Natanyahu, and \"the boys\" to discredit Abbas so that an isolated\nHamas can be attacked and destroyed later?\nRealism in diplomacy is a desirable thing. George Mitchell used to be smarter than this. His\nstaff should be advising him not to do this. Failure will be catastrophic.\nAll the players should be engaged, and they are not.

Tick, tock, another day gone. Sid\nSeptember 3, 2010\nAmericans Most Likely to Favor GOP\nNewcomers for Congress\nThree in four believe influx of new members would improve\nCongress\nby Jeffrey M. Jones\nPRINCETON, NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a Republican challenger. Given a choice of\nfour hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience, Americans are most likely to prefer \"a\nRepublican who has not served in Congress.\" Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent over\na newcomer.\nThese results, based on an Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll, underscore the advantageous political environment for\nRepublicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall, a majority of Americans prefer a Republican\ncandidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat, 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardless\nof party affiliation) to an incumbent, 54% to 39%.\nThe fact that Americans who prefer a Republican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voters\nwant both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washington\nexperience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates, on the other hand, apparently are more satisfied with the type\nof experienced representatives now in Congress.\nOne would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates, and Republicans to prefer Republican\ncandidates, and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans' preferences for incumbents versus\nchallengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress, and thus,\nmore Democrats will be defending House seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is in\nCongress to a Democrat who is not, and Republicans are more likely to prefer a Republican outside of Congress to one\nwho is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for Republican non-incumbents.\nThe data do not necessarily indicate how Americans would vote in the fall when presented with a choice of two specific\ncandidates for Congress. This fall, voters will generally be asked to choose between one Republican and one Democratic\ncandidate, one of whom may be an incumbent. When asked in the same poll whether they are more likely to vote for the\nRepublican or the Democratic congressional candidate in their district if the elections were held today, 48% of Americans\nsay the Republican and 43% the Democrat.\nThe appeal of non-incumbents is apparent in another question in the poll that finds 75% of Americans saying Congress\nwould be changed for the better if \"most of the present members of Congress are replaced with new members.\" Only 14%\nthink that would make Congress worse. This is consistent with Gallup's findings from earlier this year suggesting strong\nanti-incumbent sentiment.\nAmericans across key demographic subgroups widely share the belief that Congress would be improved if most members\nwere turned out of office. However, there is a significant gap by political party, with 89% of Republicans versus 63% of\nDemocrats saying that replacing most members of Congress would be beneficial. Again, the difference likely stems from\nDemocrats' current status as the majority party in Congress.\nImplications\nIn a year when Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation and give relatively low ratings to the president and\nCongress, it is not politically beneficial to be either an incumbent or a member of the ruling party. That is reflected in\nAmericans' preference for a Republican newcomer over other types of candidates they may have a chance to vote for in\nthis fall's midterm congressional elections. It is also reflected in prior analysis of historical Gallup data showing greater\nseat turnover in Congress when the president and Congress are unpopular.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "58 days", "type": "time_period"}, {"id": "Democrats", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Boehner", "type": "person"}, {"id": "GOP", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Americans", "type": "demographic_group"}, {"id": "Congress", "type": "governmental_body"}, {"id": "Jeffrey M.

We cd take on the critics directly and right up front and\nmake the argument this way (a lot of this is already in the intro, but wd need to be pulled together differently).\n1)We live in a new age of diplomacy - we are seeing the limits of force and we face collective problems that require\nbringing together a wider array of key players rather than any one nation dictating a solution. Active diplomacy is the\nonly option. (This is the argument david rothkopf was making to mark landler when we thought landler was doing a\nprofile - it resonated v well w/ landler.)\n2) The U.S. is uniquely suited to lead in these circumstances. a) In situations where many nations must be brought\ntogether that do not trust each other, we are still seen as the most honest broker. b) In situations where many nations\nare sitting around the table contemplating a common problem, someone has to step forward and take responsibility for\nmobilizing action (which also includes the risk of failure). We are the nation most willing to do that, both because of our\nhistory and our values. (Here is where S can offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting for us to do something) c) in a\nworld of global problems, we are the most global nation, with the greatest global reach, resources, and connections.\n3) We see global leadership not only as a responsibility but also as an opportunity, b/c of our native confidence,\noptimism and faith that problems can be solved. We have a chance to shape a genuinely global agenda, focusing on\ndevelopment as well as traditional national security issues, and mobilizing business and civil society as well as\ngovernments. This is our time.\nThe speech would then go on, as it does now, to outline all the ways in which we are building relationships and solving\nproblems now with traditional allies and new powers on the global landscape while building a longer term architecture\nof cooperation that is both truly global and adapted to solving 21st century problems.\nAM", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Roger Cohen", "type": "person"}, {"id": "v smart", "type": "opinion"}, {"id": "headline/bumper sticker", "type": "speech_element"}, {"id": "A New American Century", "type": "speech_title"}, {"id": "diplomacy", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "force", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "collective problems", "type": "issue"}, {"id": "key players", "type": "group"}, {"id": "nation", "type": "country"}, {"id": "diplomacy", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "U.S.", "type": "country"}, {"id": "honest broker", "type": "role"}, {"id": "global problems", "type": "issue"}, {"id": "global leadership", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "responsibility", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "opportunity", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "confidence", "type": "trait"}, {"id": "optimism", "type": "trait"}, {"id": "faith", "type": "trait"}, {"id": "development", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "national security issues", "type": "issue"}, {"id": "business", "type": "group"}, {"id": "civil society", "type": "group"}, {"id": "governments", "type": "group"}, {"id": "traditional allies", "type": "group"}, {"id": "new powers", "type": "group"}, {"id": "global landscape", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "architecture of cooperation", "type": "concept"}, {"id": "21st century problems", "type": "issue"}], "edges": [{"source": "Roger Cohen", "target": "v smart", "label": "agrees_with"}, {"source": "headline/bumper sticker", "target": "A New American Century", "label": "proposed_title"}, {"source": "diplomacy", "target": "force", "label": "alternative_to"}, {"source": "diplomacy", "target": "collective problems", "label": "solution_for"}, {"source": "diplomacy", "target": "key players", "label": "involves"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "honest broker", "label": "seen_as"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "global problems", "label": "confronts"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "global leadership", "label": "demonstrates"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "responsibility", "label": "sees_as"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "opportunity", "label": "sees_as"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "confidence", "label": "has"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "optimism", "label": "has"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "faith", "label": "has"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "development", "label": "focuses_on"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "national security issues", "label": "addresses"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "business", "label": "mobilizes"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "civil society", "label": "mobilizes"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "governments", "label": "mobilizes"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "traditional allies", "label": "works_with"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "new powers", "label": "works_with"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "global landscape", "label": "addresses"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "architecture of cooperation", "label": "builds"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "21st century problems", "label": "solves"}]}, "From": "Slaughter, Anne-Marie", "Date": "Saturday, September 4, 2010 11:21 AM"}, {"id": "C05771291", "title": "MOST IMPORTANTLY.....", "prompt": "We are working to incorporate some of the missing links but I haven't gotten any comments from anyone.

But Bill Clinton's appearances on the midterm election trail are starting to\nturn voters' heads in a way that Barack Obama's simply are not.\nDemocratic operatives say that Mr Clinton, who went through in 1994 the kind of setback that pollsters say Mr Obama will\nface in less than three weeks, is more effective at presenting the election as a choice between starkly different\nalternatives rather than a referendum on what people think of the Obama administration.\nSo far the president, who has booked most of the next three weeks for campaigning, has been unable to pull that off. This\nweek alone, Mr Clinton has shaken up two Senate races \u2014 in Kentucky and West Virginia \u2014 with appearances that have\nassisted Democratic candidates. Mr Clinton was due to speak in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to assist the embattled\nHarry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and then move onto California later in the week.\n\"Bill Clinton is about as close to a secret weapon as the Democratic party has got,\" says Norm Ornstein, a political analyst\nat the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"He has this ability to fire up the Democratic base that almost nobody\nelse can do right now.\" Mr Clinton's intervention in Kentucky, where Jack Conway, the Democratic candidate, is locked in\na tight race with Rand Paul, the Tea Party icon, is a good case in point.\nAt the weekend Mr Clinton described Mr Paul, who wants drastically to shrink the size of the US federal government and\nhas talked of abolishing the Federal Reserve, as a \"radical with no record to back it up\". Mr Paul, who has never run for\nelected office, hit back by reminding voters of Mr Clinton's former Monica Lewinsky scandal. \"I am not sure I would trust a\nman who had sex with an intern,\" said Mr Paul. \"I mean, do you think he's an honourable person?\"\nMr Paul's trip down memory lane appears to have backfired. Few voters seem to care any longer about a scandal that\noccurred amid what in retrospect looks like a golden age of balanced budgets, job creation and the absence of foreign\nwars.\n\"Bill Clinton's strength is that he knows how to fight back and turn adversity into advantage,\" says Tad Devine, a veteran\nDemocratic operative. \"He is also able to enter an individual race, take the temperature, understand what people are\nfeeling and then base his appeal to voters on that.\"\nIn the West Virginia Senate race, where Joe Manchin, the governor, is trailing John Raese, a wealthy local businessman,\nMr Clinton on Monday came out punching. Referring to Mr Raese's plush Florida vacation home, the former president\nsaid: \"I'm here for a lot of reasons. One is that I don't think it's fair for West Virginia to have one senator and Florida to\nhave three.\"\nAcknowledging voter anger in a state where Mr Obama has 29 per cent rating, among the lowest in the country, Mr\nClinton added: 'I am old enough to know that if you make a decision when you are mad \u2014 and I am not just talking about\npolitics here \u2014 there is about an 80 per cent chance you will make a mistake.\"\nIn contrast, a lot of Democrats are critical of the way Mr Obama has framed the midterm campaign, shifting from one\nattack line to another without sticking to an overarching narrative. Last month, Mr Obama turned on John Boehner, the\nRepublican congressional leader, in what looked like a move to depict him as the voters' alternative.\nMore recently, Mr Obama has switched to attacking the Chamber of Commerce for allegedly funnelling foreign money into\nattack ads. But it has generated a lot of criticism. \"This election is awash with undisclosed money and it's fair to point out\nhow disadvantaged the Democrats have been,\" says one consultant. \"But it isn't good politics at this late stage when\nvoters clearly want to hear about the economy.\"\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

This is both the right thing to do and getting good\npress where it counts. AM\nDear Friends and Colleagues:\nWhat if we told you a little-known bureaucratic process called \"Implementation and Procurement Reform,\"\nIPR for short, was one of the biggest victories for poor people in years? It means more aid can go directly\nthrough a country's own systems, making them stronger. It also means that more aid will be administered\nby local organizations who know best what their own communities need.\nThrough IPR, USAID is putting President Obama's recent global development policy into action. The agency\nhas set clear targets to increase use of local country systems and organizations, which means that US\nassistance will help citizens and their governments build their own capacity, instead of setting up a parallel\nsystem as they've done in recent years. They've set clear and ambitious targets for themselves that are\nlaser-focused on results, and dedicated to fighting global poverty not just in the short term, but for good.\nPhoto: Local organizations distribute assistance after performing a needs assessment in Bihar, India.\nIan Bray/OXFAM GB\nThis reform will likely be criticized by some who think that putting more money in the hands of local actors\nwill expose USAID's programs to more risk. But this is precisely the point; only by supporting local change\nagents\u2014both inside and outside developing country governments\u2014can we actually strengthen the hands of\npeople in poor countries who are working to change their own societies for the better. That means managing\nrisk wisely, rather than trying to avoid it altogether. And in our field research, 36 of the 39 activists we\ninterviewed said they want USAID to support their government's directly, because it would make it easier for\nthem to hold their governments accountable and prevent corruption.\nWhat does all this mean? It means better aid, aid that strengthens the capacity of reformers in poor countries.\nAnd for the millions of people across the world who have been demanding these reforms, USAID has shown\nit is actively listening.\nSincerely,\nThe Aid Effectiveness Team\np.s.

He is the author of \"Israel and the Bomb\" and the forthcoming \"The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's\nBargain with the Bomb.\"\nAvner Cohen, you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Why now,\nand why would that be good for Israel?\n\"Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking. It was born many years ago, and sealed as part of a\ncomprehensive deal with the United States in 1969. It was appropriate at the time, but today. in my opinion, it is not just\nanachronistic, but foolish and anti-democratic. Even in realpolitik terms, it is an 'own goal' for Israel. In my view, it\nundermines genuine Israeli interests, including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among the\nresponsible states in this strategic field.\"\nAre you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe? If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program, its usually\nmarginal. The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians. \u2022\n\"Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small, just state'\nsurrounded by enemies, and the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh. Israel's image was different then.\n\"In the long term, the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two-state solution, the more it\nwill be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons. So the world will be a lot less forgiving on the\nnuclear issue. The situation of ambiguity, in which you don't have real legitimacy, is not a good place to be.\"\nThe United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty, but during Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu's visit to Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of the\nthreats Israel faces, and these threats warrant special security measures.\nThe Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred. They want to look\nas though they respect that. This agreement [with the U.S.] has been passed along from president to president, but I don't\nbelieve this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis.\"\nDo you give credence to the slippery slope theory, under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demands\nthat Israel disarm?\n\"Those are cliches used by the defense establishment. Nobody 'demands that Israel make such an announcement without\nfirst doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states. This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous. Israel\nhas its own interests; nobody can coerce it to do things.\"\nWhat about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms race\nagainst Israel?\n\"I don't dismiss that claim out of hand, and if, after study and thought, this fear turns out to be warranted, I would be\nprepared to wait. But in some ways, ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs. The claim you mention treats Arabs as though\nthey were children: If they are told that Israel doesn't admit to it, that frees them of the need to deal with the reality. I\nbelieve the Arab countries don't want to play a game of make-believe, but rather want to discuss the topic directly and\nrealistically.\"\nYou say, basically, that Iran is imitating Israel's nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel\nsupporters.\n\"But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests, but rather by rumors. It can\neven remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If that rankles anybody, let it rankle.\n\"If Iran is not attacked, it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity; I see this as nearly certain. The international\ncommunity thus has another reason not to accept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate. The norm that a state with a nuclear\nweapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues down this path, the less\npatience the world will have for Israel.\"\nHow do you envision the scenario of 'coming out of the nuclear closet?'\n\"Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity. So long as there is a [military] censor, it is\nvery hard to alter ambiguity. If censorship didn't exist, israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject more\nopenly.\n\"Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic. There is a Shin Bet [security service] law, but there\nis no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This is a very problematic situation.\n\"On the international level, it's a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see a political statement by\nIsrael's government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table. He would talk\nabout the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic. With a few rare exceptions, these\nweapons have no military use; Israel views them as a means of deterrence. I don't think Israel would need to go into detail\nregarding how many [bombs] it has or exactly what it has.\n\"Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi, or even the United States. Ambiguity creates a sense that we are\nsinners, as though we had done something so terrible that we can't tell the awful truth - and I don't think it is so awful. This\nis a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time, and the time has come for it to say something\npositive on this huge, complicated and awe-inspiring topic...\n\"All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.\nWhether that will happen in our lifetimes I can't say.\"\nYou say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death, such as the\nquestion of whose finger will be on the button. Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion?\n\"There has been very little creative thinking in this area, and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced an\nunacceptable, closed culture incapable of creative thinking. Ambiguity's power derives from the fact that Israeli society\naccepts it, and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security.\n\"Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic, one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to be\nhandled by 'trustworthy hands' so that it does not have to take responsibility itself.\nAmbiguity has created an ignorant, craven public.which, in a certain sense, has betrayed its civic, democratic duties on\nthis subject.\"\nWhat's it like researching a topic nobody discusses?\n\"When I started studying this subject 25 years ago, I had the feeling I was entering a palace where nothing could be\ntouched. It took me years to find the right way to handle the topic responsibly - from a researcher's perspective, not from\nthe standpoint of someone who is directly involved in the matter.\nToday I think it is possible to initiate a meaningful dialogue about concrete, real issues.\"\n\u2022 Print Page\n\u2022 Send to a friend.\n\u2022 Comments\n\u2022 Share\n\u2022 Text Size -1-1:\n\u2022 Follow us on Twitter\n\u2022 Become a Haaretz.com Faceboolr friend\nThis story is by:\n\u2022 atasha Mozoovaya", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "nuclear ambiguity", "type": "policy"}, {"id": "Israel", "type": "country"}, {"id": "United States", "type": "country"}, {"id": "nonproliferation treaty", "type": "international_agreement"}, {"id": "Iran", "type": "country"}, {"id": "nuclear weapon", "type": "weapon"}, {"id": "NPT", "type": "international_agreement"}, {"id": "Benjamin Netanyahu", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Barack Obama", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Arab states", "type": "group_of_countries"}, {"id": "Israeli government", "type": "government"}, {"id": "Shin Bet", "type": "security_service"}, {"id": "Mossad", "type": "intelligence_agency"}, {"id": "Israel Atomic Energy Commission", "type": "government_agency"}, {"id": "New Delhi", "type": "city"}, {"id": "Israeli democracy", "type": "political_system"}, {"id": "Israeli public", "type": "population"}, {"id": "researcher", "type": "profession"}], "edges": [{"source": "Israel", "target": "nuclear ambiguity", "label": "policy"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "United States", "label": "international_relation"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "Iran", "label": "international_relation"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "nuclear weapon", "label": "possession"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "NPT", "label": "international_relation"}, {"source": "Benjamin Netanyahu", "target": "Barack Obama", "label": "diplomatic_relation"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "Arab states", "label": "international_relation"}, {"source": "Israeli government", "target": "Shin Bet", "label": "supervision"}, {"source": "Israeli government", "target": "Mossad", "label": "supervision"}, {"source": "Israeli government", "target": "Israel Atomic Energy Commission", "label": "supervision"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "New Delhi", "label": "international_relation"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "Israeli democracy", "label": "impact"}, {"source": "Israeli public", "target": "nuclear ambiguity", "label": "acceptance"}, {"source": "researcher", "target": "nuclear ambiguity", "label": "study"}]}, "From": "sbwhoeop", "Date": "Thursday, August 26, 2010 10:02 AM"}, {"id": "C05771430", "title": "MASHABANE CALL UPDATE", "prompt": "Ok will work on those and get back to you asap", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Ok", "type": "task_status"}, {"id": "work", "type": "task_action"}, {"id": "get back", "type": "task_action"}, {"id": "you", "type": "person"}], "edges": [{"source": "Ok", "target": "work", "label": "start"}, {"source": "work", "target": "get back", "label": "continue"}, {"source": "get back", "target": "you", "label": "inform"}]}, "From": "Jiloty, Lauren C", "Date": "Thursday, August 26, 2010 10:03 AM"}, {"id": "C05771434", "title": "ARE YOU UP", "prompt": "Calling now", "graph": {"nodes": [], "edges": []}, "From": "Abedin, Huma", "Date": "Wednesday, November 3, 2010 2:13 PM"}, {"id": "C05771438", "title": "FW:", "prompt": "Fyi\n10/13/2035", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Fyi", "type": "note"}, {"id": "10/13/2035", "type": "date"}], "edges": []}, "From": "Sullivan, Jacob J", "Date": "Thursday, October 14, 2010 12:27 PM"}, {"id": "C05771441", "title": "MASHABANE CALL UPDATE", "prompt": "Martin Indyk is free for the next 40 minutes.

Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for\ntheir nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the\nNetherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In\nHungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on \"Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire\nworld.\" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its\nleaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's\nParliament.\nContemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term \"radical populism,\" but to\nanyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.\nEconomic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the\nfirst half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is\nproducing the same toxic politics.\nThe Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much\nmore nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece\u2014which is being\nhelped, so far, by its euro-zone partners\u2014Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be\npaid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.\nBut Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give\n\"primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.\"\nLike Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The\nCzech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish\norigins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical\nRight in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: \"Antisemitism is crucial to the\nPolish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a\ngeneral hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy.\" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is\nsuspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.\nBut the record of his party activists\u2014including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-\nwing group in the Strasbourg Parliament\u2014is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet,\nKaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II\nwhen \"Jews apologize for killing Poles.\"\nMainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-\nright European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany,\nNicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy,\nand Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held\nVienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking \"Jewish\ncapital\" in language even Haider didn't dare utter.\nSo radical populism\u2014anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti-\nimmigrant rhetoric everywhere\u2014is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to\nappease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living\nand working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.\nBut a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it.\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.html\nB6\nEit\nWhat a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe\nMarine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right\nparty away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in\nthe process.\nby Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010\namuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux\nMarine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)\nleads today\nJean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right\u2014the man who for decades has played on the inchoate\nfears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters\u2014had just finished speaking\nto the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party\nfeasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the \"provocateur\" taunting\nthe establishment, the \"toreador\" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these\nyoungsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.\ndetermined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. \"She has the will, the courage, the temperament\nnecessary, and the competence,\" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. \"It seems to me indisputable that she is our\ncamp's best candidate for 2012.\"\nTall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's\nexpected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong\nFrench nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a\nfresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a\nnew threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective\u2014and thus more dangerous\u2014than her father.\nIt's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and\ncast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began\nafter his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in\nelections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So\nhe decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking\ncitizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or \"Gypsies\"),\nbooting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His\nabysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.\nThe younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. \"I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,\" she says.\n\"My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father.\" The old man could be painted as a\ncreature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a \"sulfurous\" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front\nwants to bill itself as \"neither left nor right.\" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's\nrival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, \"tent pis,\" she says.\nOther right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister\nSilvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme\u2014one of them\nthe former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out\nbetween Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly\nIslamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of\ntrying to build a new coalition government.\nYet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual\ncaricature of \"people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,\" Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes \"the American right\nis much more to the right than the National Front.\" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers\nmore effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligation\nto help its people. \"We feel the state should have the means to intervene,\" she says. \"We are very attached to public\nservices A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,\" including \"access for all to\nthe same level of health care.\"\nLe Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by\ncompeting factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the\nfamily's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was\nbrought down. The crime has never been solved. \"The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politician\nsent a word of condolence,\" she says. \"It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you.\"\nThat's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential\nrace a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.\nWith Barbie Nadeau in Rome", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Europe", "type": "location"}, {"id": "iron intolerance", "type": "political_issue"}, {"id": "politicians", "type": "political_group"}, {"id": "minorities", "type": "social_group"}, {"id": "Muslims", "type": "religious_group"}, {"id": "Jews", "type": "religious_group"}, {"id": "Roma", "type": "ethnic_group"}, {"id": "gays", "type": "sexual_orientation"}, {"id": "Geert Wilders", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "anti-Muslim", "type": "political_ideology"}, {"id": "anti-Quran", "type": "political_ideology"}, {"id": "Hungary", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Fidesz Party", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Jewish capital", "type": "economic_term"}, {"id": "Jobbik Party", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Socialists", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "political scientists", "type": "profession"}, {"id": "anti-Semitism", "type": "discrimination"}, {"id": "radical populism", "type": "political_ideology"}, {"id": "European history", "type": "historical_period"}, {"id": "ultranationalist movements", "type": "political_movement"}, {"id": "global recession", "type": "economic_event"}, {"id": "Viktor Orban", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "liberalized open markets", "type": "economic_policy"}, {"id": "Socialist government", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "austerity IMF package", "type": "economic_policy"}, {"id": "Greece", "type": "location"}, {"id": "euro-zone partners", "type": "economic_group"}, {"id": "Hungarian Guard", "type": "political_group"}, {"id": "Jean-Marie Le Pen", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "National Front", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Marine Le Pen", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "far-right party", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "French politics", "type": "political_system"}, {"id": "Nicolas Sarkozy", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "UMP party", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Silvio Berlusconi", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "Gianfranco Fini", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "Northern League", "type": "political_party"}, {"id": "Geert Wilders", "type": "politician"}, {"id": "right wing", "type": "political_ideology"}, {"id": "American right", "type": "political_ideology"}, {"id": "Ku Klux Klan", "type": "political_group"}, {"id": "illegal immigration", "type": "social_issue"}, {"id": "public services", "type": "government_program"}, {"id": "health care", "type": "government_program"}], "edges": [{"source": "Europe", "target": "iron intolerance", "label": "issue"}, {"source": "politicians", "target": "minorities", "label": "blame"}, {"source": "politicians", "target": "minorities", "label": "blame"}, {"source": "Geert Wilders", "target": "anti-Muslim", "label": "ideology"}, {"source": "Hungary", "target": "Fidesz Party", "label": "election"}, {"source": "Fidesz Party", "target": "Jewish capital", "label": "attack"}, {"source": "Fidesz Party", "target": "Jobbik Party", "label": "opposition"}, {"source": "Fidesz Party", "target": "Socialists", "label": "opposition"}, {"source": "political scientists", "target": "anti-Semitism", "label": "preference"}, {"source": "ultranationalist movements", "target": "European history", "label": "comparison"}, {"source": "global recession", "target": "ultranationalist movements", "label": "cause"}, {"source": "Viktor Orban", "target": "liberalized open markets", "label": "change"}, {"source": "Viktor Orban", "target": "Socialist government", "label": "opposition"}, {"source": "Greece", "target": "euro-zone partners", "label": "assistance"}, {"source": "Hungarian Guard", "target": "Fidesz Party", "label": "affiliation"}, {"source": "Jean-Marie Le Pen", "target": "National Front", "label": "leadership"}, {"source": "Marine Le Pen", "target": "National Front", "label": "succession"}, {"source": "Marine Le Pen", "target": "French politics", "label": "influence"}, {"source": "Nicolas Sarkozy", "target": "UMP party", "label": "association"}, {"source": "Silvio Berlusconi", "target": "Gianfranco Fini", "label": "alliance"}, {"source": "Silvio Berlusconi", "target": "Northern League", "label": "alliance"}, {"source": "Geert Wilders", "target": "right wing", "label": "comparison"}, {"source": "American right", "target": "Ku Klux Klan", "label": "comparison"}, {"source": "American right", "target": "illegal immigration", "label": "stance"}, {"source": "American right", "target": "public services", "label": "stance"}, {"source": "health care", "target": "public services", "label": "benefit"}]}, "From": "sbwhoeop", "Date": "Sunday, September 5, 2010 11:48 AM"}, {"id": "C05771510", "title": "MENENDEZ CALL WINDOWS TODAY", "prompt": "Menendez's staff has finally gotten back to us.

President Obama leads Sarah Palin 48 - 40 percent.\nRomney, Huckabee, Palin and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are bunched together when Republican\nvoters are asked who they prefer for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, the independent Quinnipiac\n(KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University survey finds.\nDemocratic voters say 64 - 27 percent they do not want anyone to challenge President Obama for their party's\nnomination in 2012.\n\"The Democratic base remains squarely behind President Barack Obama when it comes to his re-election, but\nhis weakness among independent voters at this point makes his 2012 election prospects uncertain,\" said Peter\nA. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.\n\"The demographic splits in the electorate when voters are asked whether the president deserves a second term is\na roadmap for his re-election strategists on how they need to focus their appeal. Only 39 percent of men, 34\npercent of whites, 35 percent of political independents and 38 percent of those over age 35 think he deserves\nfour more years in the Oval Office.\"\nIn trial heats for 2012, former Massachusetts Gov. Romney receives 45 percent to 44 percent for Obama, while\nthe president gets 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr. Huckabee. Matched against Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a\nvirtual unknown to most voters, the president leads 45 - 36 percent.\n\"At this point, former Alaska Gov. Palin runs the worst against President Obama. Daniels is essentially a\ngeneric Republican because of his anonymity to most voters. Obama only gets 45 percent against him while he\ngets 48 percent against Ms. Palin,\" said Brown. \"She is very unpopular among independents and although she\nrecently said she thought she could defeat Obama, the data does not now necessarily support that assertion.\"\n\"Unlike Daniels, who is a political unknown to most Americans, virtually all voters have formed an opinion\nabout Palin and that opinion is not encouraging for her candidacy.\"\nMs. Palin is viewed the most negatively by the American people of the possible Republican candidates in 2012.\nShe is viewed unfavorable by 51 percent of voters and favorably by 36 percent. Among independents, the key\nswing voting bloc, she has a negative 54 - 33 percent favorability rating.\nHuckabee gets a 41 - 25 percent favorability rating and Romney gets a 38 - 26 percent score. Former U.S.\nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich gets a negative 30 - 43 percent score.\nObama gets a 48 - 48 percent split overall, with a negative 43 - 52 percent among independent voters.\nIn a mythical Republican primary Ms. Palin gets 19 percent, including 25 percent of GOP women, followed by\nRomney with 18 percent, Huckabee at 17 percent, Gingrich at 15 percent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6\npercent and Daniels, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota at 2 percent each.\n\"The best thing Obama has going for him when it comes to his re-election may be that at this point the\nRepublicans don't have a candidate who is both nationally well-known and well- liked by a majority of voters,\"\nsaid Brown.\nFrom November 8 - 15, Quinnipiac University surveyed 2,424 registered voters nationwide, live by telephone,\nwith a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.\nThe Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in\nPennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for\nresearch.

His approach depends first\non securing end-game \"deposits\" from all parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they might\nnot be willing to give at the onset, but that can be \"deposited\" with the U.S. and committed to only if the other side is\nwilling to do the same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, for instance, would outline and agree to a package that included details\nabout Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromises\nthe Palestinians would need to accept.\nMuasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track\u2014asking Syria to deposit end-game commitments in return for\nfull Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In their deposits, the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit to\naddress the inclusion of Hamas and Hezbollah in any regional agreement. The Arab states would not only have to end all\nlogistical, financial, and military support for these two groups, but they would have to assume responsibility for\ndelivering these two actors, helping to transform them into political players. Israel's deposit would spell out its\ncommitment to a solution based on 1967 borders and a return of the Golan.\nAccording to Muasher, these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at ending\nthe conflict. After he has been given Arab cover, Abbas could provide his own end-game deposits. According to\nMuasher, absent these commitments from the Arab states, the Palestinian positions will remain maximalist. Once the\nU.S. has deposits from all sides that make for a reasonable, comprehensive package, it should put this package on the\ntable in cooperation with the Quartet. Once the comprehensive package is presented, the U.S. can focus on confidence-\nbuilding measures to move all sides toward the end game.\nAM", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Marwan Muasher", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Jordanian foreign minister", "type": "position"}, {"id": "ambassador", "type": "position"}, {"id": "deputy prime minister", "type": "position"}, {"id": "regional settlement", "type": "proposal"}, {"id": "Israeli-Palestinian conflict", "type": "issue"}, {"id": "2002 Arab Peace Initiative", "type": "proposal"}, {"id": "end-game deposits", "type": "commitment"}, {"id": "U.S.", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Saudi Arabia", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Syrian track", "type": "proposal"}, {"id": "Golan Heights", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Hamas", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Hezbollah", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Arab states", "type": "group"}, {"id": "1967 borders", "type": "boundary"}, {"id": "Quartet", "type": "group"}, {"id": "confidence-building measures", "type": "action"}], "edges": [{"source": "Marwan Muasher", "target": "Jordanian foreign minister", "label": "former"}, {"source": "Marwan Muasher", "target": "ambassador", "label": "former"}, {"source": "Marwan Muasher", "target": "deputy prime minister", "label": "former"}, {"source": "Marwan Muasher", "target": "regional settlement", "label": "advocates"}, {"source": "regional settlement", "target": "Israeli-Palestinian conflict", "label": "solution_to"}, {"source": "regional settlement", "target": "2002 Arab Peace Initiative", "label": "capitalizes_on"}, {"source": "regional settlement", "target": "end-game deposits", "label": "depends_on"}, {"source": "end-game deposits", "target": "U.S.", "label": "deposited_with"}, {"source": "end-game deposits", "target": "Saudi Arabia", "label": "deposited_with"}, {"source": "end-game deposits", "target": "Syrian track", "label": "deposited_with"}, {"source": "Saudi Arabia", "target": "Jerusalem", "label": "includes_details_about"}, {"source": "Saudi Arabia", "target": "Arab and Muslim backing", "label": "promises_to_secure"}, {"source": "Syrian track", "target": "Golan Heights", "label": "in_return_for"}, {"source": "Syrian track", "target": "Hamas", "label": "commits_to_address"}, {"source": "Syrian track", "target": "Hezbollah", "label": "commits_to_address"}, {"source": "Arab states", "target": "Hamas", "label": "commits_to_end_support_for"}, {"source": "Arab states", "target": "Hezbollah", "label": "commits_to_end_support_for"}, {"source": "Arab states", "target": "Hamas", "label": "commits_to_assume_responsibility_for"}, {"source": "Arab states", "target": "Hezbollah", "label": "commits_to_assume_responsibility_for"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "1967 borders", "label": "commits_to_solution_based_on"}, {"source": "Israel", "target": "Golan", "label": "commits_to_return_of"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "Quartet", "label": "cooperates_with"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "comprehensive package", "label": "presents"}, {"source": "U.S.", "target": "confidence-building measures", "label": "focuses_on"}]}, "From": "Slaughter, Anne-Marie", "Date": "Sunday, October 3,2010 11:21 AM"}, {"id": "C05771632", "title": "PLEDGE FOR PALESTINE", "prompt": "I'm sending 2 emails today b/c I didn't send one yesterday. :-)\nAttached is a one-pager fleshing out how we could launch a Pledge for Palestine based on the Warren Buffett model.

It was Walter Isaacson.\nNew BBG chief wants more money to combat \"enemies\" such as China and Russia Posted By Josh Rogin Tuesday,\nOctober 5, 2010 - 4:43 PM\nThe Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a new chairman in Walter Isaacson, and the former CNN and Time\nmagazine chief is calling for even more money for the BBG to combat the public diplomacy efforts of America's\n\"enemies,\" which he identifies as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China.\nThe BBG, which oversees a $700 million annual budget to run such organizations as the Voice of America, Radio Free\nEurope, and Radio Free Asia, funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, but at the\nsame time is facing increased competition from other governments' forays into international broadcasting.\nIsaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the Congress must\nallow the U.S. government to do the same.\n\"We can't allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies,\" he said. \"You've got Russia Today, Iran's Press TV,\nVenezuela's TeleSUR, and of course, China is launching an international broadcasting 24-hour news channel with\ncorrespondents around the world [and has] reportedly set aside six to ten billion [dollars] -- we've to go to Capitol Hill\nwith that number -- to expand their overseas media operations.\"\nIsaacson said that combating internet censorship would be a major focus of the BBG under his leadership and that China\nand Iran were the prime targets.\n\"China, Iran, and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies, and Beijing has deployed\narmies of cyber militias to go after their country's cyber dissidents,\" he said. \"The BBG is at the forefront of combating\nthis. Through constant innovation and technical evolution, our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway for\naudiences in China and Iran.\"\n\"We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom,\" Isaacson said. \"Wherever there is a firewall, it's our duty\nto storm it, to denounce it and to circumvent it.\"\nIsaacson was speaking at last week's 60th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe, which he credited as\ncontributing to the end of the Cold War. He made it clear the BBG's outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively,\neven if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration.\n\"It's sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition it's\ntasked with two separate missions that might conflict: first of all, covering the news with the highest journalistic\nstandards and secondly, being a part of America's public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to the\nworld,\" Isaacson said.\n\"Let me say to you, my fellow journalists, that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions,\nour mission of being credible journalists, because in fact, it's the only way to carry out the second mission. You can't do\nit unless you're credible and telling the truth, and in the end, the truth is on our side.\"\nPressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means, especially in light of reports that the Obama administration\nsought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections, Isaacson promised he wouldn't\nhesitate to air views that contradict American foreign policy on BBG stations.\nHe said that the goals of American foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about 90 percent of\nthe time -- as for the other 10 percent, a choice must be made.\n\"I feel it's the role of the BBG to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism, just as you would in the\nprivate sector,\" Isaacson said. \"We can never compromise our credibility. And in doing so, that will probably help further\nthe foreign policy interests of the United States. But if it's ever a real conflict, our goal one is to protect our credibility.\"", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Walter Isaacson", "type": "person"}, {"id": "BBG", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "$700 million", "type": "budget_amount"}, {"id": "Voice of America", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Radio Free Europe", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Radio Free Asia", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Iran", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Venezuela", "type": "country"}, {"id": "Russia", "type": "country"}, {"id": "China", "type": "country"}, {"id": "internet censorship", "type": "issue"}, {"id": "cyber dissidents", "type": "group"}, {"id": "Congress", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Russia Today", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Press TV", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "TeleSUR", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "24-hour news channel", "type": "media"}, {"id": "correspondents", "type": "group"}, {"id": "overseas media operations", "type": "activity"}, {"id": "Capitol Hill", "type": "location"}, {"id": "internet freedom", "type": "issue"}, {"id": "60th anniversary celebration", "type": "event"}, {"id": "Radio Free Europe", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Cold War", "type": "event"}, {"id": "journalists", "type": "group"}, {"id": "Obama administration", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "The Cable", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Iranian presidential elections", "type": "event"}, {"id": "foreign policy interests", "type": "issue"}], "edges": [{"source": "BBG", "target": "Walter Isaacson", "label": "has_chairman"}, {"source": "BBG", "target": "$700 million", "label": "has_annual_budget"}, {"source": "BBG", "target": "Voice of America", "label": "oversees_organization"}, {"source": "BBG", "target": "Radio Free Europe", "label": "oversees_organization"}, {"source": "BBG", "target": "Radio Free Asia", "label": "oversees_organization"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Iran", "label": "identifies_as_enemy"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Venezuela", "label": "identifies_as_enemy"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Russia", "label": "identifies_as_enemy"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "China", "label": "identifies_as_enemy"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "internet censorship", "label": "combats_issue"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "cyber dissidents", "label": "combats_group"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Congress", "label": "calls_for_action"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Russia Today", "label": "mentions_organization"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Press TV", "label": "mentions_organization"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "TeleSUR", "label": "mentions_organization"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "24-hour news channel", "label": "mentions_media"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "correspondents", "label": "mentions_group"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "overseas media operations", "label": "mentions_activity"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Capitol Hill", "label": "mentions_location"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "internet freedom", "label": "mentions_issue"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "60th anniversary celebration", "label": "mentions_event"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Cold War", "label": "mentions_event"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "journalists", "label": "addresses_group"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Obama administration", "label": "mentions_organization"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "The Cable", "label": "mentions_organization"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "Iranian presidential elections", "label": "mentions_event"}, {"source": "Walter Isaacson", "target": "foreign policy interests", "label": "mentions_issue"}]}, "From": "Abedin, Huma", "Date": "Wednesday, October 6,2010 11:01 AM"}, {"id": "C05772386", "title": "COOKSTOVES", "prompt": "Great news.

She is on an International Affairs Fellowship from the Council on Foreign\nRelations. They asked her to write the following; it was cleared by L. It is quite profound.\nBy EMILY PARKER\nIn 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home,\nsurrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded to\ndiscuss why he believes that literature can change the world.\nMr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victory\u2014and not just for a talented and prolific author. His work is\nperhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics,\nor who claim that they have \"no time\" for fiction.\nIn a New Republic essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature \"an important place in the life\nof nations.\" He wrote, 'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best\nprotector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.\"\nMr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value\nof individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that he\nis among the most successful.\nColumnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.\nA case in point is \"Conversation in the Cathedral,\" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue\nfirst from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, which\nis when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how\ndictatorships impregnate \"every act of life.\"\nTo demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The book\nopens with a grim landscape of \"uneven and faded buildings\" and describes \"dull and defeated eyes at the\ntables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer.\" The narrative, which rapidly jumps from\npast to present, describes a stalled, confused world. You don't know who to trust.\nMr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics more openly in \"The Feast of the Goat,\" which explicitly details the horrors of\nthe Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo was notorious for his victimization of women, and\nso we see life under his rule through the eyes of one young girl unlucky enough to have crossed his path. \"The\nwoman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship,\" Mr. Vargas Llosa told me.\nFor some, Mr. Vargas Llosa's victory will be controversial because of his political background and his\noutspoken views. He unsuccessfully ran for president of Peru in 1990, losing to Alberto Fujimori. During the\ncampaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety for his emphasis on a market economy, free trade and private\nproperty. He was no less controversial for his support of the invasion of Iraq, which he saw as necessary to\nending what he called the \"monstrous dictatorship\" of Saddam Hussein.\nMr. Vargas Llosa has now left politics, and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen. Or as\nhe told me in Lima: 'Through writing, one can change history.\"\nNot all of his work is dark. \"Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\" is punctuated with humor, and 'The Bad Girl,\" about\none man's world-wide pursuit of an elusive lover, is a thoroughly entertaining read. The one constant is a\nperceptive and empathetic glimpse into a wide range of human experience.\nAs Mr. Vargas Llosa wrote in his 2001 essay about literature, \"Nothing better protects a human being against\nthe stupidity of prejudice, racism, religious or political sectarianism, and exclusivist nationalism than this truth\nthat invariably appears in great literature: that men and women of all nations and places are essentially equal.\"\nMs. Parker is an international affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Emily Parker", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Wall Street Journalist", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "International Affairs Fellowship", "type": "program"}, {"id": "Council on Foreign Relations", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Lima", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Nobel Prize", "type": "award"}, {"id": "New Republic", "type": "publication"}, {"id": "Conversation in the Cathedral", "type": "literary_work"}, {"id": "The Feast of the Goat", "type": "literary_work"}, {"id": "Alberto Fujimori", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Iraq", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Saddam Hussein", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter", "type": "literary_work"}, {"id": "The Bad Girl", "type": "literary_work"}], "edges": [{"source": "Emily Parker", "target": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "label": "interviewed"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "Nobel Prize", "label": "awarded"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "Conversation in the Cathedral", "label": "authored"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "The Feast of the Goat", "label": "authored"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "Alberto Fujimori", "label": "opponent"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "Iraq", "label": "opposed invasion of"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter", "label": "authored"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "The Bad Girl", "label": "authored"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "Council on Foreign Relations", "label": "fellow at"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "Wall Street Journalist", "label": "former journalist for"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "Lima", "label": "interviewed in"}, {"source": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "target": "New Republic", "label": "published in"}]}, "From": "Slaughter, Anne-Marie", "Date": "Friday, October 8, 2010 9:47 AM"}, {"id": "C05772558", "title": "KURT CAMPBELL", "prompt": "MS \u2014 Kurt Campbell returned your call\n###", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "MS", "type": "company"}, {"id": "Kurt Campbell", "type": "person"}], "edges": [{"source": "MS", "target": "Kurt Campbell", "label": "returned_call"}]}, "From": "Jiloty, Lauren C", "Date": "Friday, October 8, 2010 5:21 PM"}, {"id": "C05772563", "title": "BEN FEDER", "prompt": "Thanks.", "graph": {"nodes": [], "edges": []}, "From": "H", "Date": "Monday, January 11, 2010 3:27 PM"}, {"id": "C05772570", "title": "UPDATE", "prompt": "Some cats and dogs:\n1.

Why Jim Jones was the worst national\nsecurity advisor in decades.\nBY DAVID J. ROTHKOPF I OCTOBER 8, 2010\nThe president's inexperience did in Jones more than any of the general's deficits. He didn't know what he wanted. He\nvacillated on key issues. He simply demonstrated the problems America repeatedly has when it hires men with no foreign-\npolicy background to take on the most important international job in the world. Further, he did not really know enough\nabout how the presidency works to nip in the bud the creation of the inner-circle bubble that effectively negated much of\nthe work that the formal policy process did. Obama encouraged (or tolerated for long-enough that it looks like\nencouragement) his campaign foreign-policy deputies to continue to report directly to him, and this led to some public and\nprivate backdooring of Jones that undercut his authority dramatically. He did not empower Jones, and that combined with\nJones's own shortcomings led to the zero-chemistry, ineffective collaboration that has been openly criticized by senior\nWhite House and foreign policy officials since the spring of Obama's first year in office.\nIn fact the situation got so bad that Jones was publicly undercut by true Obama confidante Denis McDonough more than\nonce. It is something of a surprise he lasted this long.

SID", "prompt": "aned by Woodward's Fire\nby Leslie H. Gelb\nSeptember 23, 2010 I 1:32pm\nThe president and his team cooperated with the famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb on the\nfallout\u2014and how Obama's Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.\nLots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft of History, repeatedly and boldly slipping behind the\nclosed doors of President Obama's most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president's men were\nhelping The Washington Post's sleuth write \"the inside story\" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying of\nHerculean labors\u2014the war in Afghanistan. There's only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:\nOnce the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets, many of his subordinates feel liberated to \"tell their side of the\nstory.\" By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well,\nno one looks terribly heroic.\nLet's start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he is\u2014brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused,\nand confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a\nbrilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but that\nhe trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.\nThe worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generals\ndid not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, what\nthe generals were giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down after\nthey reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). The\nmilitary didn't provide him with that, either.\nAs they say in Missouri, \"Give me a break.\" If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get what\nhe wants from the U.S. military, he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the White\nHouse who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didn't\nunderstand what he had to do\u2014tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president's\nwishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write the\nstrategy all by himself.\nThis was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clear\nenough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to\npursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president told\nWoodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the \"classic\" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. \"I think about it\nmore in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at\nthe end?\" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011\ndeadline to begin withdrawal was firm: \"I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end, and I can't lose the whole\nDemocratic Party.\" Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesn't? Or to White House aides:\n\"This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan.\" So, if he wanted such a plan, he\nshould have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.\nWhich leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations.\nAnd they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathom\nwell the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build up\ntheir arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all,\nvictory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they don't like it. For their part,\nDemocrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don't care for the suits either. It's not\na happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand.\nbreakAd\nThe White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing over\nnaughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation, the general\u2014and\nperhaps even his senior Army aides\u2014were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guys\u2014you know, the\nusual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them.\nThere's another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that, I believe, he gets more wrong than\nright. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the inner\nsanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. My\ninformation has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubt\nthat Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost\nalways quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like General\nMcChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm\nEmanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public\u2014in\nadvance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obama's top advisers did as\nmuch. The day after his West Point speech last December, where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecified\nU.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriously,\nthat everything was \"conditions based.\" That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.\nSo, if anything, most of Obama's top counselors were more or less united\u2014sometimes against where he seemed to be\ngoing. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and it's a stunner: \"You have to recognize\nalso that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It's a little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, there has been\nenormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay after\nit. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives.\" The brilliant general said as much\nto others over the last year. It's enough to knock your socks off.\nSo far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on\nforever.\nDoubtless, President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. He's sworn to that time and again, and I believe\nhim, despite his history of calling for \"victory\" and \"defeat\" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward book\ndemonstrates is that Obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. So far, there are no heroes to\nthis narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.\nLeslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist and senior government official, is author of Power Rules: How\nCommon Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy (HarperCollins 2009), a book that shows how to think about and\nuse power in the 21st century.

Nobody I spoke with\nbelieved that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its\nexpiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a\nlarge majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him\nleverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud\nvoters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state\nsolution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).\nLieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as\npossible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,\nwho oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to\nkeep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the\ngovernment now, and is willing to do so without any demand for \"rotation,\" provided Bibi is serious about\nnegotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against\nthe idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows\nKadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.\nTherefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The\nlonger he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to\noppose him in the next elections.\nIn this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that\nhe is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the\nbelief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable\nprice uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises\ndoubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final\nconcession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no\ncredit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This\ncombines with his legendary fear of being seen as a \"freier\" (sucker) in front of his people to create a real\nproblem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.\nThis is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of \"creative ideas.\" Thinking out of the box, as he\nlikes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to\nbroaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct\nnegotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.\nThe reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of\nmaking a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further\ndelegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President\nObama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling\nrelations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance\nthe future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.\nYuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky\n(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent\nterror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will\ndisappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi\ndoesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been\nseriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but\nthat Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.\nWhat is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And\nplease forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.\n1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working\nwith him, even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge\nhim forward, not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.\n2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own\npurposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security,\nfrom the vote at the IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted\nBibi's security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him.\n3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in\nterms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about\nAbu Mazen's politics.\n4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a \"clarifying moment.\" The world will of course blame\nBibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated\nsolution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The\nIsraeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and\nthey should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations\nand time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as\nwe keep the door open.\nFrom my staffer:\nAM\nAnne-Marie Slaughter\nDirector of Policy Planning\nU.S. Department of State\n(202)

The review, the first-ever such an undertaking for the\nState Department, is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects their\nstrategy and priorities.\nThe new approach to development, Clinton says, will focus on American leadership through civilian power. Both\nClinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about \"demilitarizing\" foreign policy, and Clinton\nsays the QDDR will suggest how to do that, with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development,\nmuch of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis.\nIn the article, Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document, which she called a blueprint for reforms to be\nimplemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S.\ngovernment agencies, creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that\ndevelopment undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and \"sustainable\" impact.\n\"Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the\nworld will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States'\nnational security strategy,\" Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development was\nto \"put itself out of business\" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future.\nPresident Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly when he released the \"U.S. Global Development Policy,\" which changes U.S. efforts to focus on\nbuilding up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential.\nBut the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detail\neverything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy, how the United States undertakes\n\"stabilization\" efforts in post-conflict areas, how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to the\ntypes and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach.\nAmerican diplomats going forward, Clinton said, are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Pinstripes", "type": "clothing_style"}, {"id": "cargo pants", "type": "clothing_style"}, {"id": "Clinton", "type":

Last year, a friend of mine was invited to a\nHanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions), and after the\nObamas descended the grand stairway, they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook a\nfew hands, and back up the stairs they went. No mingling.\nIn their first two years, the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people were\nhurting, especially Michelle's extravagant trip to Spain. (I'm as interested in Michelle's clothes as the next woman but at\nthe same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing, which she does. Her wardrobe seems\nquite extensive for these troubled times.)\nBarack Obama's personality has been much mulled over in the past two years, but it seems inescapable that his high self-\nesteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance, which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff, some\nof whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. \u00b0barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group,\nand three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod\u2014had had no experience in\ngoverning. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed himself with such flippancy, arrogance, and overuse of the F-word that\nhe offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President.\nVice President Joe Bider), who is liked on Capitol Hill, was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in the\nfirst two years\u2014\"I can handle them,\" Obama told Biden\u2014but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of the\nWhite House's new determination to \"reach out.\" (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore they\nwould \"reach out,\" but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama's persona is that\nsomeone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be\n\"comfortable.\"\nFor example, Torn Donilon, his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy), is by all\naccounts a capable man but is no one's idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon's\nbeing given his new position was that \"the President is comfortable with him.\" Just as Obama is described as pleased with\nhimself, he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all, he had taken on the formidable Clintons,\nand, against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts, he had beaten them. Why should he listen to those\nwho had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that there\nwere no \"grown-ups\" around, people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong.\nWhen people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in, that person was rejected as \"not one of ours.\" Joe\nBiden is said to argue with Obama on issues, such as Afghanistan, but not to get into the management of the White\nHouse....\nThose who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion, to get people to follow him. The\nfact that the Obama White House has been so poor at \"messaging\" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact, he had\nno overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aide\nabout this, he pointed to what had been billed as a \"major speech on the economy,\" at Georgetown University in April\n2009. But the speech was utterly forgettable\u2014and forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of both\nObama and his top staff. An ally says, \"You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know where\nyou're going.\" Another says, \"They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White House.\"\nThus, Obama didn't see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all over\nthe place: Stanley Greenberg, a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton, said that Obama's oft-used theme, that we\nshouldn't go back to the Bush days, actually tested negatively, because people didn't believe that the country was making\neconomic, progress.\nSo Obama's biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded his\nswearing-in may have gone to his head, while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there who\nwere not overjoyed at the advent of a black president, or even a Democrat. Obama was, apparently in his own estimation,\nso smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain\u2014and explain again\u2014to the country what he was\ndoing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010\ncampaign....\nMore than once, people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying to\ndefend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard:\n\"Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn't always think about making sure we got the\nadvertising properly about what was going on.\" Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who was\ngenerally supportive of Obama, this ordinarily polite man responded, \"Bullocks! What policies?\")\nThe risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care\n(with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his pathetic\npress conference on the day after the election. In these comments, Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn't\nreally understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me, \"Their definition of\ngoverning is passing bills.\" Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been so\ncriticized for being \"arrogant\" and \"aloof,\" he had to eat large portions of humble pie. (\"And I take responsibility for that,\"\nObama said again and again.)", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "The New York Review of Books", "type": "publication"}, {"id": "Bitter New Washington", "type": "article_title"}, {"id": "December 23, 2010", "type": "date"}, {"id": "Obama", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Washington", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Walter Mondale", "type": "person"}, {"id": "TelePrompters", "type": "device"}, {"id": "Hanukkah party", "type": "event"}, {"id": "Obamas", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Jews", "type": "group"}, {"id": "Michelle", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Spain", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Barack Obama", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Rahm Emanuel", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Joe Biden", "type": "person"}, {"id": "White House", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Torn Donilon", "type": "person"}, {"id": "national security adviser", "type": "position"}, {"id": "deputy", "type": "position"}, {"id": "Clintons", "type": "group"}, {"id": "Congress", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Winston Churchill", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Georgetown University", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Stanley Greenberg", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Bill Clinton", "type": "person"}, {"id": "black president", "type": "position"}, {"id": "Democrat", "type": "position"}, {"id": "Democratic senator", "type": "person"}], "edges": [{"source": "The New York Review of Books", "target": "Bitter New Washington", "label": "contains"}, {"source": "Bitter New Washington", "target": "December 23, 2010", "label": "published_on"}, {"source": "Obama", "target": "Washington", "label": "location"}, {"source": "Obama", "target": "Walter Mondale", "label": "mentioned"}, {"source": "Obama", "target": "TelePrompters", "label": "dependent_on"}, {"source": "Obamas", "target": "Hanukkah party", "label": "hosted"}, {"source": "Obamas", "target": "Jews", "label": "invited"}, {"source": "Obamas", "target": "Spain", "label": "visited"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Rahm Emanuel", "label": "associated_with"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Joe Biden", "label": "associated_with"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "White House", "label": "worked_at"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Torn Donilon", "label": "appointed"}, {"source": "Torn Donilon", "target": "national security adviser", "label": "position"}, {"source": "Torn Donilon", "target": "deputy", "label": "previous_position"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Clintons", "label": "opposed"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Congress", "label": "dealt_with"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Winston Churchill", "label": "quoted"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Georgetown University", "label": "gave_speech_at"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Stanley Greenberg", "label": "quoted"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Bill Clinton", "label": "associated_with"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "black president", "label": "position"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Democrat", "label": "position"}, {"source": "Barack Obama", "target": "Democratic senator", "label": "mentioned"}]}, "From": "sbwhoeop", "Date": "Thursday, December 9, 2010 1:22 PM"}, {"id": "C05777976", "title": "JAKARTA GLOBE - STATE-OF-THE-ART STATESMANSHIP FOR US, INDONESIA", "prompt": "Fyi, 21st century engagement.

But apparently not for Michael R.\nThe mayor's company, 3loomber,\n,3 L.P., said on Wednesday that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast media\nenterprise in an effort to broaden the company's influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has an\nagreement with the city to have no involvement in the \"day-to-day operations\" of his company, the endeavor, called\nBloomberg View, is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview.\n\"I think it's very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be, for sure, consistent with the\nvalues and beliefs of the founder \u2014 even if he happens to be mayor of New York City,\" said Matthew Winkler, the editor in\nchief of Bloomberg News. \"I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact, I want people to\ncome away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values.\"\nThe effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yet\nanother potent communications apparatus \u2014 one that carries his name and imprimatur \u2014 to sound off on issues that\ncollide with his job as mayor, his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire.\nBloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg has\na direct interest as mayor, like education, public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would not\navoid such issues but would disclose the mayor's involvement when warranted.\nThough Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials, he is likely to offer feedback from time\nto time before they are published, Mr. Winkler said.\n\"I think that there's a very good chance that's going to happen,\" he said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's occasional\ninvolvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain at\narm's length from the company.\nA spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city.\n\"Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded,\" he said.\nAs someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation, acquiring the platform of an editorial\npage is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloomberg's plans. (On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run for\npresident.)\nThe unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties \u2014 including Bloomberg\nBusinessweek, Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and\nbusinesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of\nstate under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.\nOpinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg, with its just-the-facts approach. In fact,\nthe mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary in\nthe blogosphere.\nBut company leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg, who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than two\nyears ago, saw an opportunity to extend their influence.\nFor a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world, starting an\neditorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service.\nThe notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an old\none in American journalism. William Randolph Hearst, for example, often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers.\nMr. Bloomberg, it would seem, is casting himself in that mold, though there are no plans for him to begin writing signed\neditorials. For now, he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him.\n\"He's accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul,\" said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City\nUniversity of New York Graduate Center, who wrote a biography of Hearst. \"This is what we all do. We try to persuade the\nrest of the world we are right. Of course we don't have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so.\"\nMr. Winkler said: \"There's a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day, literally\nseize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can't always do that with the best result with\nreporting.\"\n\"That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company, the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg, the\ncompany, that it should take advantage of,\" Mr. Winkler added.\nBloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year, giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy of\naccomplishment.\nBloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government, an operation that\nwill eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts, the company will sell, for $5,700 a year, information about government\nservices and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nation's capital.", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Bloomberg", "type": "company"}, {"id": "editorials", "type": "content"}, {"id": "Bloomberg Businessweek", "type": "media_property"}, {"id": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "media_property"}, {"id": "financial data terminals", "type": "media_property"}, {"id": "James P.

A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of\na holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. \"Richard Holbrooke died,\" she said.\nNotwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday\u2014critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery\u2014this\nsudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything about\nhim was large: his physical size, including the ultimate \"in your face\" face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-saw\nvoice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty)\nand forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, for\ndanger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). He\nwas no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular\nwars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism.\nUnlike my tearful informant, who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with him\nin the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a \"source,\" a prolific and forceful writer whose\nfavorite venues, The New Republic and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. He was\ngregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on November 1st, at the\nNew York Public Library's \"Literary Lions\" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been on\nhis feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him.\nAt sixty-nine he was tired\u2014that much was obvious\u2014but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do.\nNot long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked him\nif he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song \"The Envoy.\" He said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. After\nthat, he mentioned it every single time I've seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when he\nneeds a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way.\nIf the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become the\nSecretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, Holbrooke has left a stronger, more\npositive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a broken\nheart\u2014Kati Marton saw to that\u2014but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment that\nbrought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to be\nthe most important he ever spoke.\nPhotograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images\nRead more\nhttp://www. newyo rker. corn/on line/b log s/hend ri khe rtzberq/20 10/1 2/ho lb rooke. htm 1?p ri ntab le=true#ixzz\n1 8HjNL4kn", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "NBC/YORKER", "type": "publication"}, {"id": "December 14, 2010", "type": "date"}, {"id": "Envoy", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Hendrik Hertzberg", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Richard Holbrooke", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Greenwich Village", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Saturday", "type": "date"}, {"id": "United States", "type": "country"}, {"id": "New Republic", "type": "publication"}, {"id": "New Yorker", "type": "publication"}, {"id": "New York Public Library", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Kati Marton", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Warren Zevon", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Supreme Court", "type": "organization"}, {"id": "Secretary of State", "type": "position"}, {"id": "Marco Di Lauro", "type": "person"}, {"id": "Getty Images", "type": "organization"}], "edges": [{"source": "NBC/YORKER", "target": "December 14, 2010", "label": "publication_date"}, {"source": "NBC/YORKER", "target": "Envoy", "label": "author"}, {"source": "Envoy", "target": "Hendrik Hertzberg", "label": "author"}, {"source": "Envoy", "target": "Richard Holbrooke", "label": "subject"}, {"source": "Greenwich Village", "target": "Envoy", "label": "location"}, {"source": "Saturday", "target": "Richard Holbrooke", "label": "event_date"}, {"source": "Richard Holbrooke", "target": "United States", "label": "citizenship"}, {"source": "Richard Holbrooke", "target": "New Republic", "label": "contributor"}, {"source": "Richard Holbrooke", "target": "New Yorker", "label": "contributor"}, {"source": "New York Public Library", "target": "November 1st", "label": "event_date"}, {"source": "New York Public Library", "target": "Envoy", "label": "location"}, {"source": "New York Public Library", "target": "Kati Marton", "label": "event_attendee"}, {"source": "Richard Holbrooke", "target": "Kati Marton", "label": "spouse"}, {"source": "Richard Holbrooke", "target": "Warren Zevon", "label": "acquaintance"}, {"source": "Supreme Court", "target": "2000", "label": "event_date"}, {"source": "Supreme Court", "target": "Envoy", "label": "potential_position"}, {"source": "Marco Di Lauro", "target": "Getty Images", "label": "photographer"}]}, "From": "Mills, Cheryl D", "Date": "Thursday, December 16, 2010 9:30 AM"}, {"id": "C05778456", "title": "UPDATE", "prompt": "Hi.
