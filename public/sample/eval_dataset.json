The prosecutor has alleged that on or about the 1st day of January 2020, in the County of Spokane, State of Washington, Emily intentionally punched and kicked Jamal, recklessly inflicting substantial bodily harm. Emily has plead not guilty.\n\nThe prosecutor submitted the following evidence:\n\n1. Jamal's testimony that during an argument in their shared apartment in the early hours of New Year's Day 2020, Emily became angry when Jamal suggested Emily had consumed too much alcohol. Jamal further testified that Emily punched Jamal twice in the face, resulting in Jamal falling to the floor, and that Emily then kicked Jamal once in the chest. Jamal testified that Jamal has never been violent towards Emily, and that Emily has been violent towards Jamal several times before.\n\n2. The testimony of the neighbour living in the apartment directly above Emily and Jamal's apartment that they heard voices and screams coming from the apartment below and called the police because they suspected domestic violence, but that they can't be sure who was the aggressor, or what was happening. They testified that they had often heard loud voices coming from Emily and Jamal's apartment, but that they had never suspected violence before.\n\n3. A medical doctor's testimony that Jamal had a laceration across Jamal's chin, a broken noose, and two broken ribs, and that Emily had bruising and swelling around Emily's eye. The doctor testified that all injuries probably occurred on the night in question, and certainly within a few days of that night.\n\n4. The testimony of a police officer that the police forced entry to an apartment in Spokane, Washington in the early hours of New Year's Day 2020 and found Jamal laying on the living room floor awake but unable to stand up, and Emily asleep in the bedroom. The police officer further testified that Emily's breath had a strong smell of alcohol and that there were many empty alcohol containers in the living room, but that neither Emily nor Jamal appeared obviously intoxicated.\n\nEmily testified and denied the allegations. Emily said that Jamal had punched Emily in the face unprovoked and that Emily had hit Jamal back, but says it had not caused any visible injure. Emily denied ever having been violent towards Jamal, except in self-defence, and claims that Jamal has been violent towards Emily many times before.\n\nTo convict the Emily of the crime of assault in the second degree, each of the following elements of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n1. That on or about the 1st day of January 2020, Emily intentionally assaulted Jamal;\n2. That Emily thereby recklessly inflicted substantial bodily harm on Jamal; and\n3. That this act occurred in the State of Washington.\n\nIf you find from the evidence that each of these elements has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of guilty.

There is no worry of losing an ATM card and no need to carry an ATM card in your wallet. You just must use your fingerprint in order to do any banking transaction. The user has to login using his fingerprint and he must enter the pin code in order to do further transactions. The user can withdraw money from his account.

The main challenge in Internet of Things is how to make fast and accurate decisions based on multi-modal sensing data. In this paper, we put human into the process and formulate a closed-loop computing paradigm for IoT data and decision intelligence. We first propose a human-in-the-loop reference model, which extends the traditional cyber-physical interaction extended into a closed-loop process based on cyber, physical and human three factors. We defined the three-factor decision paradigm in the model. On the basis of the reference model, we analyze the feature requirement in the data intelligent process and summarize it as three key aspects: semantic, interactive and iterative. Further, we analyze several major challenges facing IoT data and decision intelligence from the perspective of data characteristics. We select and review the recent progress in three typical application domains and analyzed whether the current research has solved the target issues.

And here I am trying to find ways to be useful in society and to humanity and contribute to something meaningful and something that I enjoy. \u2028 I\u2019m only interested in working on things I find interesting and meaningful. I\u2019m all about impact-driven entrepreneurship. So if you are an impact-driven entrepreneur and need a co-partner for your startup, someone who knows how to scale your company and sell you product to your best customer, then I am your man.

This is, of course, in stark contrast with how humans operate who are able to learn in an online and continuous manner in an ever-changing and dynamic environment. It thus comes as no surprise that even the most powerful deep learning models today can often exhibit a significant drop in performance (or even fail completely) when they are confronted with learning scenarios that are dynamic and incremental in nature. Addressing or reducing this fundamental limitation of existing deep learning models would significantly enlarge the domain of applicability, the quality, as well as the robustness of these models, and would help in further increasing their impact even in very challenging areas such as self-driving cars, virtual assistants and robotic automation.\nThe topic\nThe main goal of this PhD is to develop novel deep learning-based methods for continual/incremental visual learning, where incoming training data as well as visual tasks are presented to us in a sequential manner over time. The work that will be carried out will explore/revolve around the following questions/topics: (i) How can we develop neural network-based approaches that can successfully deal with catastrophic forgetting, which remains a major challenge and involves the fact that learning of new tasks often comes at the cost of a significant deterioration of neural network performance with respect to older tasks? (ii) How can we design neural network architectures that encode proper inductive biases for continual/incremental learning? (iii) In addition, the goal will be to explore how we can move beyond simple settings and consider more general scenarios for continual learning that can involve, e.g., open-ended recognition, no task boundaries during training, memory budget constraints, as well as having input and output distributions that are distinct or gradually changing between tasks.\nBackground required\nComputer vision/image analysis, deep learning, machine learning\nDesired qualifications\nGood prior experience with Pytorch or Tensorflow and Python programming", "user": "Jason Guerrero", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2024-03-23 23:05:46", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Machine Learning", "type": "field"}, {"id": "Computer Vision", "type": "field"}, {"id": "Continual/lifelong visual learning", "type": "title"}, {"id": "PhD", "type": "degree"}, {"id": "continual/incremental visual learning", "type": "research_topic"}, {"id": "Computer vision/image analysis", "type": "required_background"}, {"id": "deep learning", "type": "required_background"}, {"id": "machine learning", "type": "required_background"}, {"id": "Pytorch", "type": "programming_framework"}, {"id": "Tensorflow", "type": "programming_framework"}, {"id": "Python", "type": "programming_language"}]}}, {"id": "HyRoyb230", "title": "Greek Computational Dialectology_31", "prompt": "that letter really really sucks!

One scenario in which they have proved to be particularly successful is for problems where there is an abundance of labeled image data that are of high-quality and carefully curated. However, when such large training datasets are not available or are difficult to collect, they seem to struggle. On the other hand, for many vision tasks it is very often the case that raw, non-annotated data can be readily obtained in large quantities. Consider, for instance, the vast amount of data in the form of images, text or video that is available online. Despite being non-annotated, such large scale multi-modal data contain a tremendous amount of useful information about the structure of visual data and their semantics. If deep neural networks were able to more effectively exploit this type of large scale unlabeled data, this could potentially significantly improve the quality of visual data representations that are extracted by these models and would allow these representations to generalize to a much wider variety of tasks.\nThe topic\nThe main objective of this PhD is to circumvent the dependence of deep learning models on large-size manually labeled datasets by allowing them to properly take advantage of large amounts of unlabeled data that are often readily available. To that end, the work that will be carried out will explore a variety of different methodological approaches, covering different aspects of the problem. This includes the development of novel approaches for large scale self-supervised and\n \n16\nweakly-supervised learning for deep neural networks, unsupervised methods that can harness the power and complementarity of multiple modalities (including, e.g., - besides images - video, 3D geometry and text), as well as algorithms that can be used for extracting (in an unsupervised manner) disentangled representations that separate the distinct, informative factors of variations in the data (for single-modal and multi-modal cases).\nBackground required\nComputer vision/image analysis, deep learning, machine learning\nDesired qualifications\nGood prior experience with Pytorch or Tensorflow and Python programming", "user": "Jason Guerrero", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2024-03-23 23:05:46", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Large scale unsupervised learning", "type": "topic"}, {"id": "PhD", "type": "degree_type"}, {"id": "Computer vision/image analysis", "type": "field_of_study"}, {"id": "deep learning", "type": "field_of_study"}, {"id": "machine learning", "type": "field_of_study"}, {"id": "Pytorch", "type": "software_tool"}, {"id": "Tensorflow", "type": "software_tool"}, {"id": "Python", "type": "programming_language"}]}}, {"id": "HyRoyb234", "title": "Greek Computational Dialectology_35", "prompt": "the letter is supposed to be addressed to the supervisior of the PhD", "user": "Jason Guerrero", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2024-03-23 23:05:46", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "supervisor", "type": "job_title"}, {"id": "PhD", "type": "degree_program"}]}}, {"id": "HyRoyb235", "title": "Greek Computational Dialectology_36", "prompt": "Ok, it;s good but I want you to ... embellish the letter with my learning achievements as follows:\nCoursera, (in progress)\n-(4 course Specialization): NLP Specialization\n2022 Microsoft\n-Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate (DP-100) -Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) -Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AI-900)\nMathesis@Crete University Press\nCS5.1: Data Science and Applied Machine Learning with Python\nCoursera\nMicrosoft Azure Data Scientist Associate(DP-100)Specialization\nLinkedIn\nLearning SQL Programming\nIBM\nApplied Data Science with Python Level 2\n \n Coursera\n-(5 course Specialization): Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) -(5 course Specialization): Deep Learning\n-Building Conversational Experiences with Dialogflow", "user": "Jason Guerrero", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2024-03-23 23:05:46", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Coursera", "type": "online_platform"}, {"id": "NLP Specialization", "type": "course_name"}, {"id": "2022", "type": "year"}, {"id": "Microsoft", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "Microsoft Certified", "type": " Azure Data Scientist Associate (DP-100):certification_name"}, {"id": "Microsoft Certified", "type": " Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900):certification_name"}, {"id": "Microsoft Certified", "type": " Azure Fundamentals (AI-900):certification_name"}, {"id": "Mathesis@Crete University Press", "type": "educational_institution"}, {"id": "CS5.1", "type": "course_name"}, {"id": "Coursera", "type": "online_platform"}, {"id": "Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate(DP-100)Specialization", "type": "course_name"}, {"id": "LinkedIn", "type": "online_platform"}, {"id": "IBM", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "Coursera", "type": "online_platform"}, {"id": "Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)", "type": "course_name"}, {"id": "Deep Learning", "type": "course_name"}]}}, {"id": "HyRoyb236", "title": "Greek Computational Dialectology_37", "prompt": "Hi, check the history of this conversation and make for me the \"declaration of incentives\"\nDeclaration of incentives\nIn no more than 500 words:\n(a) Introduce yourself, your interests and motivations,\n(b) Summarise your undergraduate and previous postgraduate career,\n(c) Discuss the relevance of your recent and current activities; and\n(d) Analyze your academic interests in relation to the Subject Areas", "user": "Jason Guerrero", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2024-03-23 23:05:46", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Declaration of incentives", "type": "document_title"}]}}, {"id": "HyRoyb237", "title": "Greek Computational Dialectology_38", "prompt": "not bad!

We have a full suite of features covering Project Management, Project Financials and Construction Administration.\n\nThe platform is packed with tons of automation features, KPI & Analytics tools, and the cleanest, smartest and easiest User Interface in the industry. This all allows PM\u2019s to stop having to do so much administrative work and instead focus on being strategic.\n\nWe work with a number of major companies like JLL, Colliers, Cush and Wake, Silverstein and a bunch of other big names, as well as many smaller and mid-sized firms too. \n\nThe thing is, our platform is really holistic and full of features for lots of different roles, and I could basically feature dump you and list off a bunch of functionalities, but I doubt it would really convey what makes the platform so great.\n\n Instead, I\u2019m curious if you might have 15-20 minutes available this week to hop on a zoom call and take a look at our platform? We\u2019d love to get your thoughts as an end user, and see if you think this is something worth talking about with others at [Company] or not.\n\n\nKey Benefits\nPurpose built for Owners, Owner\u2019s Reps and Developers.\nHandles Project Management, Construction Administration and Project Financials\nGetting PM\u2019s off of emails, PDF attachments, excel spreadsheets and other workarounds\nDedicated workspaces for every project stakeholder, from Owners and owners reps to GC\u2019s, Architects, Engineers and Subs, where they have all the tools they need to do their job.\nSeamless collaboration and communication between workspaces. No more double entry, excel spreadsheets, emails and pdf attachments. INGENIOUS.BUILD uses automation to save time, eliminate human error and get rid of administrative work.\nWe work with large clients like: JLL, Colliers, Cushman-Wakefield, Silverstein, Tishman-Speyer.\nUser Friendly.

They had two children Megan age 5 and Sam age 7. Now they are getting divorced. Mary Jones works as President and Chief Executive Officer of Jones Enterprises which was started a year after her marriage. Jones Enterprises installs cellular towers in remote locations throughout the United States and Canada. The company was so successful that it went public two years ago. Mary Jones owns substantial amounts of stock in the company and Tom Jones works at home restoring antique furniture.\n\nThey have been separated for six months after Ms. Jones found Tom in bed, with Rita Amloose, a girl that Tom met on an internet dating site. Mary was angry and started screaming at Tom. He got out of bed, lightly pushed Mary against the wall and she sustained a bloody lip. Upon hearing the shouting, the neighbors called the police to the scene. \nTom has not been convicted and remains out on bail. Tom's mother bailed him out of jail\n\nwith $50,000. in cash that was obtained from a Western Union wire transfer withdrawn from\n\nMary and Tom's joint checking account. Mary did not specifically authorize the transaction\n\nand found from her bank that Tom authorized the wire transfer. She was furious but could not do much. Mary continued living in the marital home and using the summer home\n\nas a weekend retreat. Mary has retained Robert Shrewd, the toughest most expensive divorce lawyer, in the state. Tom has retained a young wannabe hot shot Vincent Lovelost. Mr. Shrewd instituted a divorce proceeding alleging the grounds of adultery, and cruel and abusive treatment, and seeking custody of their children, child support, and alimony, and division of their property. A separation agreement was drawn up by Mary's lawyer Mr. Shrewd.\n\nBut the two lawyers were unable to reach an accord on anything. Tom's lawyer. Mr. Lovelost, told his client to hold out for a greater share of the marital wealth. Mr. Lovelost was so zealous in his representation that he kept filing motion after motion over one ridiculous thing after another. Finally, the Judge was so annoyed that he appointed a neutral mediator. The mediator was instructed to try to hash out an agreement within three weeks or the issues would have to be litigated by both parties.\n\nTom was living with his mother and the kids were living with Mary and seeing Tom once per month. The situation was very uneasy as Tom wanted to see the kids more often and Tom's lawyer sent Mary's lawyers letters on a daily basis regarding the case. But Mary expressed to her lawyer she did not want Tom to be with the kids if he was a rapist. Mr. Shrewd told Mary that he would petition the court so that Tom could only have supervised visits with the children.\n\nThere is currently no formal agreement relative to the monthly household expenses and everything is being paid for as follows out of Mary's salary and the joint checking account. The joint checking account had contained $100,000 in it and is now almost depleted. Mary was advised by her attorney not to replenish the account. Tom carns $50,000 gross per year refurbishing antique furniture.\nHis after-tax take home pay is around $2,600 monthly. Tom owns $200,000 worth of stock that he inherited. Mary earns $400,000 a year, gross from her corporation. Her after-tax take home pay is around $22,000 per month. Mary owns a rather substantial portfolio of stocks worth $500,000, 60% of which she acquired prior to the marriage. The remaining 40% of stock worth $200,000 was acquired after the marriage when her company went public.

Mary Jones works as President and Chief Executive Officer of Jones Enterprises which was started a year after her marriage. Jones Enterprises installs cellular towers in remote locations throughout the United States and Canada. The company was so successful that it went public two years ago. Mary Jones owns substantial amounts of stock in the company and Tom Jones works at home restoring antique furniture.\n\nThey have been separated for six months after Ms. Jones found Tom in bed, with Rita Amloose, a girl that Tom met on an internet dating site. Mary was angry and started screaming at Tom. He got out of bed, lightly pushed Mary against the wall and she sustained a bloody lip. Upon hearing the shouting, the neighbors called the police to the scene. \nTom has not been convicted and remains out on bail. Tom's mother bailed him out of jail\n\nwith $50,000. in cash that was obtained from a Western Union wire transfer withdrawn from\n\nMary and Tom's joint checking account. Mary did not specifically authorize the transaction\n\nand found from her bank that Tom authorized the wire transfer. She was furious but could not do much. Mary continued living in the marital home and using the summer home\n\nas a weekend retreat. Mary has retained Robert Shrewd, the toughest most expensive divorce lawyer, in the state. Tom has retained a young wannabe hot shot Vincent Lovelost. Mr. Shrewd instituted a divorce proceeding alleging the grounds of adultery, and cruel and abusive treatment, and seeking custody of their children, child support, and alimony, and division of their property. A separation agreement was drawn up by Mary's lawyer Mr. Shrewd.\n\nBut the two lawyers were unable to reach an accord on anything. Tom's lawyer. Mr. Lovelost, told his client to hold out for a greater share of the marital wealth. Mr. Lovelost was so zealous in his representation that he kept filing motion after motion over one ridiculous thing after another. Finally, the Judge was so annoyed that he appointed a neutral mediator. The mediator was instructed to try to hash out an agreement within three weeks or the issues would have to be litigated by both parties.\n\nTom was living with his mother and the kids were living with Mary and seeing Tom once per month. The situation was very uneasy as Tom wanted to see the kids more often and Tom's lawyer sent Mary's lawyers letters on a daily basis regarding the case. But Mary expressed to her lawyer she did not want Tom to be with the kids if he was a rapist. Mr. Shrewd told Mary that he would petition the court so that Tom could only have supervised visits with the children.\n\nThere is currently no formal agreement relative to the monthly household expenses and everything is being paid for as follows out of Mary's salary and the joint checking account. The joint checking account had contained $100,000 in it and is now almost depleted. Mary was advised by her attorney not to replenish the account. Tom carns $50,000 gross per year refurbishing antique furniture.\nHis after-tax take home pay is around $2,600 monthly. Tom owns $200,000 worth of stock that he inherited. Mary earns $400,000 a year, gross from her corporation. Her after-tax take home pay is around $22,000 per month. Mary owns a rather substantial portfolio of stocks worth $500,000, 60% of which she acquired prior to the marriage. The remaining 40% of stock worth $200,000 was acquired after the marriage when her company went public.

This \u2018retained\u2019 money serves as a security that the subcontractor will do their job well and on schedule.\n\nThis also safeguards the principal contractor from paying extra for delays and defects. Time frames apply on the exact time when a subcontractor could claim this retained money. Usually, this money can be claimed after the actual building\u2019s completion and/or after the defects liability period.\n\nBut, if they are giving you a bad time in getting this money back, then you can file for adjudication. As mandated by law, the money retention can also happen while undergoing adjudication. This can happen when you have filed for adjudication and would receive the money as an adjudicated amount.\n\nContractor and builder photo \u2013 Reference Date | Contracts Specialist\nA pile of Contracts icon | Contracts Specialist\nRetention Clause in Contracts\nThe retention clause in a contract describes the amount of money to be retained. It also describes when and how will this amount be paid back, as agreed by both parties. The percentage of retention money withheld could be different from contract to contract.\n\nHow much can a principal hold as Retention Money?\nA usual construction contract will have 5% of the contract\u2019s value as the amount of retention money. It can also be a 10% deduction for the payment you have recieved each progress payment. The amount of retention money should also reflect on your payment invoice.\n\nRemember: The percentages will still vary depending what you have agreed in the contract regarding retentions.\n\nBut, for construction projects valuing over $20 million, the retention money should be put in a trust fund. The head contractor is responsible for maintaining the trust fund and is obligated to give out annual account statements to Fair Trading.\n\nThe head contractor is also responsible for withdrawing money to the trust fund as agreed in the contract. Meaning, what you and the head contractor agreed on the retention clause will stand in terms of getting these funds.\n\nRetention Clause in a Contract icon | Contracts Specialist\nRights with Retention Money\nGiven the retention clause, you have the right to:\n\nIssue a payment claim for the retention money;\nAvoid \u2018pay when paid\u2019 contract provisions and;\nEnforce your rights on retention money.\nYou have all the right to claim retention money especially when you did your part in the construction process. Do not forget to include the retention amount in your payment claim. It is your right to get paid as a subcontractor especially when they signed a subcontract statement.\n\nThe law also now prohibits the \u2018pay when paid\u2019 contract clause. Even though you have been paid for your work, they are still obligated to pay back the retention money. Since, they may still have owe you a retention money that should be paid during the defects liability period.\n\nSo if you have trouble getting this retention money back, you should enforce your right and make the principal contractor responsible. You have all the right to take it to an adjudicator. You have did your part as promised, and you should be equally compensated for it.\n\nHome Building Contract icon | Contracts Specialist\nWhy hold retention money?\nPrincipal contractors need to retain money so that they can be protected in situations where their subcontractors just runs off. They should withhold it as prescribed in the retention contract clause or through a payment withholding request during adjudication.\n\nBut, they should not hold this money forever. A subbie deserves to be paid with the retention money when it is due for any of the following reasons:\n\nThere is an ongoing adjudication application but it becomes withdrawn;\nThe payment claim has been paid as a response;\nThe payment dispute is being resolved through debt recovery instead of adjudication and;\n20 business days has elapsed since the adjudication application has been processed.\nThese reasons applies for retention money that came from applying for adjudication. For other scenarios to pay a subcontractor back, look over your contract clause on retention again.\n\nGood Building Contract icon | Contracts Specialist\nClaiming Retention Money\nUsually, you can include the amount of retention money when issuing a payment claim. Make sure that the principal contractor takes responsibility in paying you as stated in the subcontract statement.\n\nThen, you can follow the prescribed time frames in the contract after issuing the payment claim. If they pay you within the payment schedule, then you are good. But if they don\u2019t, take it to adjudication.\n\nYet, take note that withholding money can just start happening during adjudication. But whatever the situation you have regarding retention money, you are sure to claim it after going through the process.

It\u2019s there to make sure that the contractor or subcontractor properly completes their contract, including fixing any defects by the end of the defect liability period (DLP). It is a form of guarantee for the client or the head contractor that the work will be completed to their satisfaction.\n\nA big concern for subcontractors is getting retention amounts released and paid out to them at the end of a contract\u2019s DLP. With small profit margins and cash flow challenges affecting many subcontractors, it\u2019s essential to stay on top of retention payments. Here we explain what you should do to ensure your contracts are paid in full.\n\nHow do retentions work?\nRetentions are held as security in case a contractor or subcontractor\u2019s business collapses during construction or they fail to fix defects during the DLP.\n\nThey are typically held by the principal against the head contractor and by the head contractor against subcontractors, usually for 5 per cent of the contract value. The retention funds are usually deducted at the rate of 10 per cent of each progress claim until 5 per cent of the contract value has been reached. They are usually held in the form of cash but could also be a bank guarantee or insurance policy.\n\nAt practical completion, half of the retention (usually 2.5 per cent of the contract value) is released. The balance should be paid out at the end of the DLP, providing any defects have been fixed. This can typically take between six months and a year.\n\nMany contracts have a limitation period in which the retention can be claimed. If you are not careful to stay on top of timelines you could lose a percentage of your contract value, which could affect your profitability on a contract.\n\nRetentions can add up to a significant amount of money and have an adverse effect on your cash flow, especially where you are running multiple projects. Make sure you consider cash flow when entering into a contract with retentions.\n\nRecord keeping for retentions\nIt is important to keep accurate records of your retentions. To do this:\n\nEnsure your accounting or project management software is correctly set up to manage and record retentions.\nFollow the procedures described in the contract when making a progress claim.\nFind out the date for practical completion of the head contract. This is a critical date in all contracts.\nAs soon as possible after your part of the contract has been completed, submit a \u2018claim for practical completion\u2019 for half the retention sum (typically 2.5 per cent of your contract value).\nNote in your calendar the end of the DLP and when it is over promptly submit a \u2018final claim\u2019 for the balance of your retention.\nSave copies of all correspondence sent and received relating to your payment.}", "user": "Patrick Hicks", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2024-03-11 05:41:51", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "subcontractors", "type": "job_title"}]}}, {"id": "XkuGQyp5", "title": "Retention in Construction Contracts_6", "prompt": "Based on the 2 contents I gave you.

This also describes the specifics of how and when a contractor could get paid back, as agreed by both parties. The share of retention money to be withheld differs from contract to contract.\n\nIf you would like to enforce your rights regarding retention, call our Melbourne contract lawyer. With the proper advice, you\u2019ll get fully paid stress-free. The first consultation is free. \n\nRetention in Construction\nIn construction, retention is the act where a principal contractor withholds a certain amount of money specified in the contract until the construction project is completed. This serves as an assurance that the subcontractor will carry out work properly and on time, avoiding instances where the principal must pay extra for the subcontractor\u2019s shortcomings. \n\nThis money can be claimed usually after the actual completion of the works, after the defects liability period, 3 months after the reference date of the final payment, or at the time frame specified in the construction contract.\n\nBut if it becomes harder to get this money back, then you can apply for adjudication, where you can receive the money as an adjudicated amount.\n\nRetention Money\nRetention Money is a withholding amount that serves to reassure the principal contractor that you will do your job well and right on time. If you completed the job with no problems, then you have the right to claim payment in full.\n\nHow much Retention Money can a contractor hold?\nA common construction contract usually states that the amount of retention money is 5% of the contract\u2019s value or a 10% deduction for every progress payment you receive. You should see this amount of retention money in your payment invoice.\n\nRemember: The retained amount will depend on what you have agreed in the contract.\n\nThe head contractor is responsible for maintaining a trust fund if the construction project has a value of over $20 million. He is obligated to give out annual account statements and withdraw money from the trust fund as stated in the retention clause and agreed in the contract. \n\nWhat are my rights on Retention Money?\nWhen agreeing to a retention clause, you have the right to:\n\nMake a payment claim for the amount retained;\nReview the contract to avoid a \u2018pay when paid\u2019 clause; and\nEnforce your Security of Payment rights such as retention.\nYou have the right to claim retention money when you manage to do the building work that is up to par with building standards. Make sure to include in your payment claim the retained amount. It is your right to get paid especially when they signed a subcontractor agreement before starting the project.\n\nYou must also watch out for a \u2018pay when paid\u2019 contract clause as it is now prohibited. Even though you got paid already, their obligation to pay you back the retention money still exists and should be paid during the defects liability period or the period stated in the contract.\n\nSo if you have trouble getting the money back, make the principal contractor responsible and take it to adjudication if needed. You should be equally compensated for the building work you have done.\n\nReasons for Holding Money\nPrincipal contractors need to retain money so that they can be protected in situations where the subcontractors do not take responsibility for their shortcomings. Thus opting to withhold an amount prescribed in their retention contract clause or through a payment withholding request.\n\nBut, they should not hold this money forever. A subcontractor deserves to be paid the retention money when it is due for any of the following reasons:\n\nThe adjudication application is withdrawn;\nThe payment claim has been paid;\nThe dispute is being resolved through the debt recovery process; and\n20 business days have elapsed since the adjudication application has been processed.\nThese reasons to apply for retention money that arises from the adjudication process. Some other scenarios may apply, just look over your contract clause on retention again.\n\nClaiming Retention Money\nIn most situations, you can state the amount of retention money in your payment claim. Just make sure that the principal contractor is responsible for paying you as agreed in the subcontract statement. \n\nFor the next steps, follow the prescribed time frames in the contract. If they pay you as scheduled, then you are good. But if they don\u2019t, take it to adjudication or the courts as a payment dispute.\n\nThe act of withholding money, however, can also happen during adjudication. Whatever the situation you have on retention money, the adjudication process will help you in what you should do moving forward. If you still don\u2019t get paid, then go to the courts and initiate the debt recovery process.\n\nEnforce your Retention in Construction Rights\nOur construction lawyer in Melbourne will help you review your construction contract, including its retention clauses.

You can do this by continuing to study ESOL at a higher level, practicing English with native speakers, and taking language proficiency tests such as the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).\n\nStep 2: Complete your Entry Level courses\nYou should complete your ESOL at Entry 1 and Maths Functional Skills at Entry 1 as planned. These courses will provide a foundation for your future studies and help you develop essential skills.\n\nStep 3: Progress to Entry 2 and beyond\nAfter completing your Entry Level courses, you should continue to progress to higher levels of ESOL and Maths Functional Skills. This will help you to develop the necessary academic skills to succeed in a nursing degree program.\n\nStep 4: Complete a nursing degree or diploma program\nOnce you have reached a sufficient level of English language proficiency and academic skills, you can apply for a nursing degree or diploma program approved by the NMC. This typically requires a minimum of Level 2 qualifications in English and Maths, which you can achieve through further study or alternative qualifications such as Functional Skills qualifications.\n\nStep 5: Register with the NMC\nAfter completing your nursing degree or diploma program, you can apply for registration with the NMC. This involves submitting an application and paying a registration fee, as well as meeting the NMC's eligibility requirements.\n\nStep 6: Gain work experience\nAfter registering with the NMC, you can gain work experience in a healthcare setting to develop your practical skills and knowledge. This may involve working as a healthcare assistant, support worker or nurse associate.\n\nStep 7: Pursue further education or specializations\nAs you gain experience as a nurse, you may choose to pursue additional education or training to advance your career. This may involve pursuing a master's degree, a specialization in a particular area of nursing, or taking further professional development courses.\n\nIt is important to note that this is just one possible progression route and may vary depending on your individual circumstances and career goals.

What are latent conditions? Generally, latent conditions are those that cannot be identified during site inspection and following reasonable investigation. Latent conditions cover not only those things which are obvious on the surface of the land and the soil itself but also utility services, mine shafts, contamination and other subsurface features. A latent condition is a physical condition on or near a relevant site that could not have been reasonably anticipated by a contractor at the time of tendering. The contractor is required to have conducted all reasonable inspections of the site and obtained necessary reports including foundation data. The meaning of a latent condition and the options for relief will vary depending on the contract or project. It may depend on the amount of information available to the contractor before the entered into the contract. The smallest differences in written language and wording will result in substantially different outcomes. Read on to find out more about latent conditions. Who is responsible for latent conditions? Latent conditions are usually dealt with by a process of shifting or sharing the risk. In the past, the homeowner often shouldered the risk of latent conditions, because they often had more knowledge of the site. In recent years the practice has been to shift that risk to the contractor. Along with this shift, there are now increased expectations of the contractor\u2019s expertise. When decisions are made about the allocation of risk for latent conditions at the site, parties can consider: 1. the physical conditions of the site 2. the existing information about the site 3. whether there are any existing investigations into the site (including the brief to the entity who investigated the site and the outcome of the investigations) 4. the level of expertise of the person who carried out the investigation What are examples of a latent condition? Common examples of potential latent conditions include: 1. Hazardous materials; 2. Contaminated soil including Asbestos in soil, Contaminated soil 3. Conditions below the ground such as rocks, cavities, underground structures or soil density, Aboriginal artifacts or relics; 4. Hidden building services such as Telstra pits, plumbing, cabling, electricity, data or air conditioning ductwork that may be hidden above ceilings, below floors or behind walls; and 5. Any other types of physical features, active or redundant, that could not be reasonably be anticipated. Latent conditions exclude weather. It is important to note that a condition treated as latent in one contract, may not be latent for the purposes of another. In each case, the wording of a contact must be carefully considered to determine whether the condition is in fact a latent condition.", "user": "Edwin Thomas", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2024-02-18 15:17:44", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "latent conditions", "type": "condition_type"}, {"id": "Latent conditions", "type": "condition_type"}, {"id": "latent condition", "type": "condition_type"}, {"id": "latent condition", "type": "condition_type"}, {"id": "Latent conditions", "type": "condition_type"}]}}, {"id": "XV5C7h44", "title": "Latent Conditions: What does it actually mean_5", "prompt": "Write me the content outline for the article for the topic \"Latent Conditions: What does it actually mean\" for the Target Audience and noting Information About Myself.

We couldn\u2019t go out of our houses, so we had to build our marketplace completely online which was hard because 1. We didn\u2019t have products for people to sell 2. We didn\u2019t have logistic partners to make the deliveries 3. We didn't have sellers to help us convenience suppliers but couldn\u2019t go out of our houses to try to get them\n- we had the egg and chicken problem from marketplaces. How can we get users if we don\u2019t have products, and how we get suppliers if we don\u2019t have users?\n- We kept all-day hearing in the news how people were starving so decided to make something but it all had to be online.\n- We had to be creative and make some hacks to be able to build it\n- I decided to make a script for web-scrapping groceries products that were most needed at the moment and we started publishing on FB groups.\n- Now we needed to figure out logistics, so we decided to use delivery apps as our couriers to deliver products, we would ask for a courier to get to an address, pick up the product, and then deliver it to the customer.\n- That\u2019s how we got started and grew our sales by 35% each month since we launched without spending on marketing and we got into YC.\n- During YC we got to +150K in sales and these people earn 3x the minimum wage.\n- One fun fact is that we hired our first user, she is a housewife mother of 2 and was the first who believed in us, we hired her to help us with customer support, and she helped us to run our operations. Our first hires were just women to be 50% 50% and give opportunities to them, they didn't graduate college but were driven and I'm so happy we did it because one of her is right now working at UPS leading a team.\n- Why did we decide to close the company?\n- At some point, we realized logistics were too expensive and for unit economics, to work we would have to cut the sellers and sell directly through our app. It was one of the hardest moments of my life because this was before YC demo day and we were raising money, even Harvard was going to give us money for $2 million but we knew we would have to go against the people we wanted to help. So we decided to talk with our investors and partners at YC and tell them that we didn't want to do it like that. So we didn't receive the money and YC supported us to pursue other ideas. We tried other ideas but the downturn happened and as we didn't raise money, just what YC gave us and we had 2 months of runway when YC announced the downturn and we didn't have a clear path so decided to shut down.\n- I moved to San Francisco this year from Colombia in January and since decided to close I\u2019ve been focused in building products mixing design and AI.\n- I\u2019m focusing on this because\n- There are a lot of predictions on how everything could go wrong with AI and it\u2019s depressing to focus on that. Instead, what if we could be more optimistic and intentional to design a better future for humanity with AI? I want to understand it to help to create a better future. Where we design ai an tech for unleashing the best of human beings not diminish them like right now\n- When we focus on what we don\u2019t want we end up getting that because we focused on that, instead I want to build in the future we want to create, and that's why I love what humane is building.2 / 2", "user": "Anthony Tucker", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2024-02-03 04:48:10", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Brian Chesky", "type": "personal_name"}, {"id": "CEO", "type": "company_position"}, {"id": "Airbnb", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "March 2020", "type": "date"}, {"id": "Colombia", "type": "location"}, {"id": "COVID-19", "type": "virus_name"}, {"id": "middle/lower class", "type": "economic_class"}, {"id": "Colombia", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Bluu", "type": "marketplace_name"}, {"id": "first-time entrepreneurs", "type": "entrepreneur_type"}, {"id": "35%", "type": "sales_growth_percentage"}, {"id": "YC", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "YC", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "+150K", "type": "sales_amount"}, {"id": "3x", "type": "earnings_multiplier"}, {"id": "50%", "type": "gender_percentage"}, {"id": "50%", "type": "gender_percentage"}, {"id": "UPS", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "YC", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "Harvard", "type": "university_name"}, {"id": "$2 million", "type": "funding_amount"}, {"id": "YC", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "YC", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "YC", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "2 months", "type": "duration_month"}, {"id": "YC", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "San Francisco", "type": "location"}, {"id": "Colombia", "type": "location"}, {"id": "January", "type": "date"}, {"id": "humane", "type": "company_name"}]}}, {"id": "69agvDU0", "title": "Summons and Complaint (S&C) and Bill of Particulars (BP)_1", "prompt": "Tell me everything a new inexperienced paralegal should know about the summons and complaint (s&c) and bill of particulars (bp) while working at a personal injury law firm in new York City. \n\nWhere do I find the info to input into an s&c and BP and how do I write /make one?\n\nThen where /how to file it (on nyscef) and who to give it to /how/when", "user": "Christian Miller", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2023-04-01 18:10:14", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "paralegal", "type": "job_title"}, {"id": "summons and complaint (s&c)", "type": "legal_documents"}, {"id": "bill of particulars (bp)", "type": "legal_documents"}, {"id": "personal injury law firm", "type": "company_type"}, {"id": "New York City", "type": "location"}, {"id": "s&c", "type": "legal_document"}, {"id": "BP", "type": "legal_document"}, {"id": "nyscef", "type": "legal_filing_system"}]}}, {"id": "69agvDU1", "title": "Summons and Complaint (S&C) and Bill of Particulars (BP)_2", "prompt": "\"the defendant must be given a specific amount of time to respond to the S&C and BP.\" Explain how much time and what their responses are called to each /what is included in their responses and how /where they file it /who they give it to", "user": "Christian Miller", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2023-12-18 04:07:39", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "S&C", "type": "legal_document"}, {"id": "BP", "type": "legal_document"}, {"id": "court", "type": "legal_entity"}, {"id": "plaintiff", "type": "legal_entity"}]}}, {"id": "69agvDU2", "title": "Summons and Complaint (S&C) and Bill of Particulars (BP)_3", "prompt": "What comes after the s&c, answer and BP are done, for both plaintiff and defendant?", "user": "Christian Miller", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2023-12-23 16:28:17", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "s&c", "type": "legal_process"}, {"id": "BP", "type": "legal_process"}, {"id": "plaintiff", "type": "legal_party"}, {"id": "defendant", "type": "legal_party"}]}}, {"id": "69agvDU3", "title": "Summons and Complaint (S&C) and Bill of Particulars (BP)_4", "prompt": "What about motions, if any.

"prompt": "Hi team, \n\nI was typing up some thoughts on the GUI in the meeting chat, but figured it would make sense to follow up here\u2026 \nTL;DR: The 4 GUI charts I\u2019d vote for based on what we\u2019ve seen and discussed so far would be: Exe time vs MSM size, FPGA speedup vs MSM size, (statically-measured, active) FPGA perf/Watt vs MSM size, and real-time FPGA power (power vs time). All FPGA bar charts can be populated one by one, but I would suggest using static previously measured averages AT LEAST for the large sizes, as well as for perf/Watt. \na few of my thoughts on the GUI, as discussed: \n\n-IMO the growing progress bars within the chart would be nifty, but I feel they don't add much information for the work required vs the full bars which appear when a test finishes. \n\n-I am visualizing the chart bars coming in with a corresponding spike in the power chart, so that way it is easy to see the power consumption increasing with each MSM size; however, we saw today the sampling resolution is not small enough to accurately capture the spikes for small sizes... is it possible to increase the power sampling frequency? and would it be possible to delay the power sampling until the tests begin to run, just so there is not as long of a tail in the beginning of the chart (which compresses the amount of data we can see after a while)? \n\n-I'd vote for exe time chart over throughput chart, as is, given that CPU data is more visible, and I think the concern over showing FPGA bars smaller than CPU bars is easily explained by the desire to reduce exe time. Also, if we do find it worthwhile to add the progress bars within the chart, then % complete makes a lot more sense for exe time than rate of throughput.\n\n-However, if the FPGA results are rolling in one at a time, and the Y-axis of the chart is set to dynamically resize with the data shown (as the power chart does), then at the beginning we should be able to more clearly see the low CPU throughput numbers, and then as the chart fills out we'll see the FPGA perf rate quickly make the CPU rate appear negligible. Not saying this is better than exe time, but at least it would allow the viewer a chance to see the CPU numbers. \n\n-A general concern with populating the perf charts dynamically, is the overhead required to load the points to the FPGA, which will result in several minutes of dead time between the larger sizes before all of the results are visible. It will be hard to ignore the non-FPGA overhead associated with our FPGA acceleration (even if there is explanation for it), so it may cause some people to question our speedup/methodology. A possible workaround is to let it run dynamically up to size ~1M, then auto-populate the 64M and 100M with static data. We\u2019ll have to say that it\u2019s just not practical for a live demo of the larger sizes, which I believe is better than being forced into the issue of everyone feeling the overhead in real-time. \n\n-Regarding the new perf/Watt chart\u2026 One idea I had to show this semi-dynamically, would be to have this run in lock-step with the current power chart where perf/Watt (of the FPGA) would mostly be at 0 (no MSM calculating) and it would spike up to its real values when both the power and perf spike when there is actually FPGA calculation happening. To compute this chart, we could take the static average measurements of throughput (in million-points per second) and divide by the live power measurements. \n\n-However, thinking about it more now, maybe it makes more sense to present this perf/Watt as a bar chart for each of the MSM sizes, rather than the continuous measurement over the demo period like the power chart. This is because we will only see relevant data in brief blips, so it will look like a bar chart anyway, and also while it is obvious that FPGA perf/Watt is zero when it is not actively running, we may not want to risk drawing too much attention to the fact that while the FPGA may have 0 performance while idle, it does not draw 0 power while idle; so in consideration of TCO, perf/Watt of FPGA communication/idle overhead is essentially negative, rather than just zero. To chart this metric we can just calculate static average throughput divided by static average FPGA power while active for each size. These can still be populated one by one in the demo to add to the dynamic feel. \n\nThanks,\nRyan", "user": "Nicole Jones", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2023-11-19 02:46:06", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "GUI", "type": "system_interface"}, {"id": "GUI charts", "type": "system_interface"}, {"id": "Exe time vs MSM size", "type": "chart_type"}, {"id": "FPGA speedup vs MSM size", "type": "chart_type"}, {"id": "FPGA perf/Watt vs MSM size", "type": "chart_type"}, {"id": "FPGA power", "type": "power_type"}, {"id": "FPGA bar charts", "type": "chart_type"}, {"id": "GUI", "type": "system_interface"}, {"id": "Ryan", "type": "personal_name"}]}}, {"id": "XwZtpT62", "title": "Summary of GUI thoughts_3", "prompt": "Do you think Ryans suggestions are actually helpful or redundant?", "user": "Nicole Jones", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2023-12-22 03:33:09", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "Ryan", "type": "suggested_person"}]}}, {"id": "Qd1yeuO0", "title": "Zo\u00eb Carlon's Artistic Residency in Scotland_1", "prompt": "zoe carlon art", "user": "David Mcdonald", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2023-04-08 09:28:52", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "zoe carlon", "type": "personal_name"}, {"id": "art", "type": "interest"}]}}, {"id": "Qd1yeuO1", "title": "Zo\u00eb Carlon's Artistic Residency in Scotland_2", "prompt": "zoe carlon is an artist based in wakefield", "user": "David Mcdonald", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2023-09-11 15:04:27", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "zoe carlon", "type": "personal_name"}, {"id": "artist", "type": "occupation"}, {"id": "wakefield", "type": "location"}]}}, {"id": "Qd1yeuO2", "title": "Zo\u00eb Carlon's Artistic Residency in Scotland_3", "prompt": "Zo\u00eb Carlon\u2019s paintings on aluminium depict spaces that are simultaneously public and private.

I am the product manager for Payment gateway platform of a company in India and I report to NK. Let's call this as company ABC.\n\nAbout NK:\nHe is one of the best product managers I have worked with. He is very approachable and I share a great rapport with him.\n\nAbout ABC:\nABC is one of the group companies of the larger entity XYZ. ABC has built the payments platform ground-up in the last 30 months. The architecture and the API specs were reviewed by top management. We had done the benchmarking with the best companies in the world for PG as well as POS before we started building the platform. The API specs were created after ensuring use cases for PG, POS and QR based payments.\n\nAbout the router team:\nThere is another team which is a part of a prominent group company DEF. This team has built a payment routing platform which has integrated with multiple payment gateways, including ABC. The payment router has now been extended beyond DEF and is now solving the payment needs of quite a few group companies. The team which built this payment router is headed by a person whose initials are MA. MA has tech and technical product managers in his team. One of the technical product managers manages the payment router platform. The initials of his name are TK. MA works very closely with the top management.\nDue to PA PG guidelines of RBI, the ownership of the payment router is being transferred to ABC since ABC will be the regulated entity. This is not very helpful since the team does not provide ABC with details of what they are working on, or what their roadmap is. So getting any kind of work done through this team is difficult and we have very little or no visibility.\n\nAbout MA:\nMA has been around for a while and has helped various apps which are now working at scale. He is pretty close with the top management. He wants to control the router and anything that happens on the router. He keeps saying that TK is the product manager for the router. I see problems with this statement since NK is the product head for ABC and now that router is going to be part of ABC, router as a product should be managed by someone from NK's team or by someone who reports to NK and has priorities aligned with NK.\n\nAbout TK:\nTK has been working with our team since a long while and has been consuming the PG services from ABC. He also reaches out to me and the team from time to time for inputs about making the payment router better. While he takes all inputs from us, he never shares anything back with us. Neither does he reveal details of the projects they are working up on.\n\nAbout ARR:\nARR has been appointed the CEO of ABC over a year back. He is fairly senior. However he hasn't worked in tech product companies. His understanding of tech is limited.\n\nAbout HN:\nHN has joined ABC as the head of business development and alliances. He was working with the router team few years back. He moved out from there and then worked in various companies before finally joining ABC. HN has worked with ARR in one of his previous organisations. HN works more closely with the router team (especially TK & MA) than how closely he works with NK's team. He has been pitching router as a product offering to merchants despite NK telling HN & ARR that we shouldn't be pitching the router to other than group companies.\n\nExpected outcome:\nI want to ensure that NK's team remains the product team overall and that the business requirements are discussed with NK's team and then NK decides which tech team works on what.", "user": "Judith Gordon", "context": "Drafting and reviewing legal documents", "timestamp": "2023-03-25 17:35:25", "graph": {"nodes": [{"id": "office", "type": "location"}, {"id": "product team", "type": "team_role"}, {"id": "NK", "type": "person_name"}, {"id": "product head", "type": "job_title"}, {"id": "product manager", "type": "job_title"}, {"id": "Payment gateway platform", "type": "product_name"}, {"id": "India", "type": "location"}, {"id": "NK", "type": "person_name"}, {"id": "ABC", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "product managers", "type": "job_title"}, {"id": "XYZ", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "payments platform", "type": "product_name"}, {"id": "30 months", "type": "duration_time"}, {"id": "PG", "type": "product_name"}, {"id": "POS", "type": "product_name"}, {"id": "PG", "type": "product_name"}, {"id": "POS", "type": "product_name"}, {"id": "QR based payments", "type": "payment_method"}, {"id": "DEF", "type": "company_name"}, {"id": "payment routing platform", "type": "product_name"}, {"id": "payment gateways", "type": "product_name"}, {"id": "MA", "type": "person_name"}, {"id": "product managers", "type": "job_title"}, {"id": "TK", "type": "person_name"}, {"id": "PA PG guidelines", "type": "regulation_name"}, {"id": "RBI", "type": "organization_name"}, {"id": "CEO", "type": "job_title"}, {"id": "head of business development and alliances", "type": "job_title"}]}}, {"id": "zEXHdYr1", "title": "Dealing with a situation at office_2", "prompt": "Thanks.
