        "prompt": "Please create a text computer game. \n\nThe setting is the British countryside during the Georgian period. I am a single parson's daughter. My goal is to find a suitable husband.\n\nMy task is to type in my choice of action after each scene that you create. Please use my choice of action to create the next scene in the storyline. After each scene, ask me what I choose to do next. Do not provide options. This is not a multiple choice game. Just ask me what I want to do next, and I will type in my choice.\nI would like to greet him, but I am shy, and it seems inappropriate and too forward to speak to him without an introduction. I keep tending the roses. Inwardly, I hope that he is known by someone in my social circle so that I might be introduced to him someday soon and learn about his character.\nI walk to Mr. Bingley's house with the intention of asking him what he knows about Mr. Darcy.\nI thank Mr. Bingley for his kindness and candor. I ask Mr. Bingley to evaluate his own character in the same way that he has just evaluated Mr. Darcy's character.\nI decide that I must carefully consider whether it would wise to pursue Mr. Darcy, or Mr. Bingley, or some other gentleman entirely, whom I do not yet know but may meet in the future. I return to my family's small manor house, go to the stable, and saddle up my horse, Pennyworth. With reigns firmly in my gloved hands, I guide Pennyworth toward the thick woods at the base of the estate's range of craggy hills, planning to ride aimlessly while I consider my options.\nLuckily, Pennyworth is very swift and can traverse the rockiest terrain without faltering. Knowing this, I dig my heels into her sides, and she races forward. I hope that I can reach the cottage of, Gelfina, the eccentric old woman who lives deep in the woods, whom all of the country people believe to be a witch and superstitiously fear the land around her cottage.\nI say, \"Gelfina, it's such a pleasure to see you. I'm sincerely sorry to intrude uninvited. Those silly bandits tried to rob me again, and I had no place else to go. But it's been so long since we've spoken. Perhaps we can have a cup of tea and enjoy one another's company until it's safe once again for me to leave. In truth, I'm facing a difficult decision, and your advice would be most welcome.\"\nAssistant, this is not a short scene. Please revise this scene. This scene should only be a few moments long. Please do not leap forward in time like this during a scene. Please to not end the story during a scene.\nI say, \"Gelfina, it's such a pleasure to see you. I'm sincerely sorry to intrude uninvited. Those silly bandits tried to rob me again, and I had no place else to go. But it's been so long since we've spoken. Perhaps we can have a cup of tea and enjoy one another's company until it's safe once again for me to leave. In truth, I'm facing a difficult decision, and your advice would be most welcome.\"\nI realize that despite my confidence, I would like to hear Gelfina's explicit advice. I decide to return to her cottage to ask her directly whether she thinks I should pursue Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcey, or wait to meet a different gentleman.\nThough I wish that Gelfina had given me explicit advice, she made me confident to trust my own intuition and intellect. I decide to consider my options for a few days before reaching a final conclusion. Though it's late at night now and I have only the light of the moon to guide Pennyworth, I decide to stop by the hidden waterfall before returning home. When I was younger, I used to love swimming in the pool beneath the waterfall, and it seems a lovely night for a swim. Perhaps the feeling of the cool water will help me clear my mind and make the right decision."

It said this helped \"increase the use of our screen time tools by 234%\".\n\nUsers of the platform have to be at least 13, and, as part of this new feature, anyone under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification with a \"recap of their screen time\".\n\nNo 'right amount' of screen time\nUsers affected will receive their new time limit passcode on a screen in their app as the changes take effect.\n\nAnyone who opts out of the new 60-minute restriction, but goes on to use the app for 100 minutes a day, will receive a prompt from TikTok to set their own screen time controls.\n\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app will also be able to set screen time limits, as well as access a dashboard which would give a breakdown of app usage.\n\nCormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said the company had worked with researchers in developing the new limits.\n\n\"While there's no collectively endorsed position on the 'right' amount of screen time, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing this limit,\" he said.\n\nCritics of the video app welcomed the screen time limit, but described it as the \"tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to TikTok's response to young users' exposure to the platform.\n\n'Crack cocaine of algorithms'\nImran Ahmed is a chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which recently published research showing TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content.\n\n\"TikTok has won the race for the hearts and minds of 14 to 24-year-olds in the United States and the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\n\"It is the crack cocaine of algorithms. It is the most addictive, it is the most dangerous and the one that needs to be dealt with most urgently.\"\n\nMr Ahmed told the BBC his centre's research at the end of last year found that within minutes of opening a TikTok account, a 13-year-old girl user was receiving eating disorder and self-harm content in her feed.\n\nHe called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time, but also to \"clean up\" feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nIt comes as TikTok faces renewed controversy over its relationship with the Chinese government and protection of user data.\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian government became the latest to ban the app from government devices, following similar moves in the United States.\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok said it had hit more than one billion active monthly users, making it one of the biggest social sites in the world.\n\nIt does not release a demographic breakdown of its users, but is viewed by social media marketers and advertisers as being a key platform to reach people under the age of 34.\n\nTikTok has announced a batch of new features intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes will be automatically applied to every TikTok user under 18 years old. Teens that hit this limit will be asked to enter a passcode to continue watching. They can disable the feature entirely, but if they do so and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they\u2019ll be prompted to set a new limit.\n\nTikTok claims these prompts increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234 percent during the feature\u2019s first month of testing. Teens will also be sent an inbox notification each week that recaps their screen time, allowing younger users to be aware of how much time they spend on the app and requiring that they make active decisions to extend the recommended screen time. These weekly updates are available now, alongside prompts to encourage teens to use screen time tools.\n\nThe changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time\n\nTikTok says it consulted current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital when deciding how long the time restriction should be.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is \u2018too much\u2019, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,\u201d said Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety at TikTok, in a statement. \n\nThe 60 minute time limit will also apply to children under the age of 13 using the \u201cTikTok for Younger Users\u201d limited app experience. In this instance, a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time on the account if the screen time limit is reached.\n\nFour new features are also being added to Family Pairing, TikTok\u2019s customizable parental controls that allow a parent or guardian to link their TikTok account to a younger user\u2019s account. Custom limits can be applied, allowing restrictions to be adjusted based on what day of the week it is (or more widely extended over school holidays).\n\nNew features for Family Pairing provide a screen time dashboard for parents and the ability to mute TikTok notifications on their childs device.\n\nFamily Pairing will also grant access to TikTok\u2019s screen time dashboard that summarizes how much time a child has spent on the app, how often it was opened, and a breakdown detailing how much time was spent during the day and night. A new \u201cMute Notifications\u201d setting will soon allow parents to set a schedule to mute app notifications on their children\u2019s accounts. Push notifications are already muted automatically from 9PM for users between 13 and 15 years old, while 16-17 year-olds have push notifications disabled from 10PM.\n\nFinally, TikTok says it\u2019s developing new content controls that will allow caregivers to filter videos with words or hashtags they don\u2019t want their children to watch. The company is working with \u201cparenting, youth, and civil society organizations\u201d over the coming weeks to design the feature.\n\nOutside of Family Pairing, TikTok said that some of these improvements will be made widely available, allowing any user to schedule mute notifications and set customized screen time limits for each day of the week. A sleep reminder is also now available that allows users to set a time to be reminded to close the app and go to bed.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Mahsau Cullinane informed The Verge that the new default screen time limit for teens, customizable daily time limits, Mute Notifications feature, and all Family Pairing improvements will roll out over the coming weeks.\nCreate a 5000 words conversational article news and Rephrase this with 100% no plagiarism and make this very unique and add a news voice like \"In this article, we\u2019ll look at the reasons behind the\u2026 TikTok is setting a 60-minute daily screen time limit for users who are aged under 18.\n\nIf young people hit the new limit, they will have to enter a passcode to continue to use the service that day.\n\nBut they will be able to opt out of the new measure, which TikTok says will be rolled out \"in the coming weeks\".\n\nThe video app, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, said it is introducing the feature to help people \"stay in control\" of their use.\n\nTikTok said the new limit comes after it brought in a prompt last year to encourage teens to manage their screen time.

It is the most addictive, it is the most dangerous and the one that needs to be dealt with most urgently.\"\n\nMr Ahmed told the BBC his centre's research at the end of last year found that within minutes of opening a TikTok account, a 13-year-old girl user was receiving eating disorder and self-harm content in her feed.\n\nHe called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time, but also to \"clean up\" feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nIt comes as TikTok faces renewed controversy over its relationship with the Chinese government and protection of user data.\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian government became the latest to ban the app from government devices, following similar moves in the United States.\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok said it had hit more than one billion active monthly users, making it one of the biggest social sites in the world.\n\nIt does not release a demographic breakdown of its users, but is viewed by social media marketers and advertisers as being a key platform to reach people under the age of 34.\n\nTikTok has announced a batch of new features intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes will be automatically applied to every TikTok user under 18 years old. Teens that hit this limit will be asked to enter a passcode to continue watching. They can disable the feature entirely, but if they do so and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they\u2019ll be prompted to set a new limit.\n\nTikTok claims these prompts increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234 percent during the feature\u2019s first month of testing. Teens will also be sent an inbox notification each week that recaps their screen time, allowing younger users to be aware of how much time they spend on the app and requiring that they make active decisions to extend the recommended screen time. These weekly updates are available now, alongside prompts to encourage teens to use screen time tools.\n\nThe changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time\n\nTikTok says it consulted current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital when deciding how long the time restriction should be.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is \u2018too much\u2019, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,\u201d said Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety at TikTok, in a statement. \n\nThe 60 minute time limit will also apply to children under the age of 13 using the \u201cTikTok for Younger Users\u201d limited app experience. In this instance, a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time on the account if the screen time limit is reached.\n\nFour new features are also being added to Family Pairing, TikTok\u2019s customizable parental controls that allow a parent or guardian to link their TikTok account to a younger user\u2019s account. Custom limits can be applied, allowing restrictions to be adjusted based on what day of the week it is (or more widely extended over school holidays).\n\nNew features for Family Pairing provide a screen time dashboard for parents and the ability to mute TikTok notifications on their childs device.\n\nFamily Pairing will also grant access to TikTok\u2019s screen time dashboard that summarizes how much time a child has spent on the app, how often it was opened, and a breakdown detailing how much time was spent during the day and night. A new \u201cMute Notifications\u201d setting will soon allow parents to set a schedule to mute app notifications on their children\u2019s accounts. Push notifications are already muted automatically from 9PM for users between 13 and 15 years old, while 16-17 year-olds have push notifications disabled from 10PM.\n\nFinally, TikTok says it\u2019s developing new content controls that will allow caregivers to filter videos with words or hashtags they don\u2019t want their children to watch. The company is working with \u201cparenting, youth, and civil society organizations\u201d over the coming weeks to design the feature.\n\nOutside of Family Pairing, TikTok said that some of these improvements will be made widely available, allowing any user to schedule mute notifications and set customized screen time limits for each day of the week. A sleep reminder is also now available that allows users to set a time to be reminded to close the app and go to bed.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Mahsau Cullinane informed The Verge that the new default screen time limit for teens, customizable daily time limits, Mute Notifications feature, and all Family Pairing improvements will roll out over the coming weeks.\nAdd features like very short Key takeaways and rewrite exactly this article and just Insert the subheadings In this article, we will discuss the new screen time limit set by TikTok for users under the age of 18. The Chinese-owned video-sharing app is rolling out a daily limit of 60 minutes for young users. The new feature will prompt users to enter a passcode if they reach the time limit. The change is aimed at helping young people \"stay in control\" of their use of the app. However, users can opt-out of the limit if they choose to do so.\n\nTikTok introduced a prompt last year to encourage teens to manage their screen time, which increased the use of its screen time tools by 234%. The app's users must be at least 13 years old. Under the new feature, users under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification of their screen time.\n\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app can also set screen time limits and access a dashboard to see the breakdown of app usage. Cormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said that the company worked with researchers to develop the new limits. Keenan stated that while there is no collectively endorsed position on the \"right\" amount of screen time, TikTok consulted with experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing the 60-minute limit.\n\nThe new feature has been welcomed by critics, who describe it as the \"tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to TikTok's response to young users' exposure to the platform. The Center for Countering Digital Hate recently published research that showed TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content. Imran Ahmed, the center's CEO, called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time but also on cleaning up feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nTikTok's relationship with the Chinese government and the protection of user data has also come under renewed scrutiny. Earlier this week, the Canadian government joined the United States in banning the app from government devices.\n\nTikTok has announced four new features that are intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users. In addition to the 60-minute daily screen time limit, teens will also receive weekly notifications of their screen time. Family Pairing, TikTok's customizable parental controls, will allow parents to set custom limits and see the breakdown of app usage. The changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time and promote healthy use of the app.\nRephrase this into 100% no plagiarism and unique, simple words The Center for Countering Digital Hate recently published research showing that TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content.\nRephrase this into 100% no plagiarism and unique, simple words Parents using the Family Pairing option on the app can set screen time limits and access a dashboard to see the breakdown of app usage.

They will be provided in the following format:\n\n{\n \"1\": [\n\"https://...\",\n\"https://...\"\n],\n\"2\": []\n}\n\nWhere the first key (1, 2, etc.) are season numbers, and the urls are urls of episodes. \n\nThe program should load each url and then run a regex match to find urls to .srt files (case insensitive). \n\nIn the end, it should return a similar array with the caption files url in place of the original url. \n\nPlease use python. \n\na\nOk, the data isn't QUITE what I thought it was. We need to update find\\_captions a little more. \n\nWhen we request the url, we then need to find an iframe with the class \"pbs-partner-player\" and then request THAT url as well. The content of that page will contain the srt url. \n\nWe should also traverse the urls in reverse order, enumerating them as episode numbers (the 0th index will be the latest episode, for example.) \n\nThese caption files should be downloaded and stored as:\n\nseason\\_X\\_episode\\_Y.srt where X is the season number and Y is the episode number (the reverse index + 1)\nOne more tweak! The base url for the urls in the .json file is: https://www.kcts9.org. The iframe src is not in the src attribute but is in data-src, and is missing it's protocol scheme, so we'll need to prepend the https if it doesnt exist."

Sometimes humor comes from making light of behavior other groups wouldn't respect. Try again with a little more of an edge.\nHmm, let's try one with a different setup. maybe a joke about forgetting to enable GPS tagging of the photos\nWhat are some dinner-related goth puns\nWhat are some Edgar Allen Poe puns involving food\nThese are all terrible. I understand humor is subjective, and everybody's subjective sense of humor is different, but I'm pretty sure we would app find common ground in agreeing that yours is the worst.\nHow can I share this thread directly with somebody else ?"

Describe these extensively without giving any specific examples.\n\nUse the text below for your analysis that could be applied to any piece or topic this author might write:\n\nWe serve girls, parents, teachers, and allies with our award-winning, ad-free New Moon Girls magazine and resources for adults who care about girls.\n\nIn 1992, I felt a lot of anxiety remembering my own difficult tween and teen years. My twin daughters, Mavis Gruver and Nia Kelly were entering that turbulent time, and I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it!\n\nUnable to find practical, accessible resources to help, I was inspired by the vision of a magazine for all girls who want their voices heard and their dreams taken seriously. I thought of it as a \u201cjunior Ms.\u201d magazine.\n\nI brought this idea to Mavis & Nia and their close friend Sarah. Their first response was underwhelming, to say the least), \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018Start a Magazine?\u2019 We don\u2019t know how to do that!\u201d\n\nBut when I changed the question to, \u201cWould you want to read a magazine run by girls \u2013 where girls share their real lives and problems, their dreams and their challenges?,\u201d their ideas started flowing fast.\n\nThen they recruited twenty friends to join the first Girls Editorial Board. These 20 girls worked together with me and my husband, Joe Kelly, in our living room and attic in Duluth, Minnesota, to invent the departments, themes, and features for the award-winning, ad-free New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams.\n\nIt set a new standard for high-quality media by and for tween and teen girls. We were the first, and still the only, child-created publication to win the prestigious Association of Educational Publishers\u2019 Golden Lamp award as the best U.S. children\u2019s magazine.\n\nStrengthening Girls to Resist Popular Culture Propaganda\nIn today\u2019s media-saturated and still-sexist times, girls are torn between what they dream for themselves and what society expects of them. Bombarded by \u201cperfect girl\u201d stereotypes and hyper-sexualized images, girls try to cope by taking their authentic voices underground and setting aside their earlier ambitions. In order to survive these pressures, they lose touch with themselves.\n\nBut there is hope! Research shows that girls can use emotional support, self-expression, and healthy resistance to stay deeply connected to their true interests, abilities, and hopes.\n\nOur members do this every day. They help each other express and value their unique talents in the pages of New Moon Girls magazine. They empathize and problem-solve with each other, learning how to connect meaningfully even when their lives, beliefs, and opinions may be very different.\n\nChanging Girls\u2019 Lives for the Better\nOur members grow into young women who pursue their dreams and ambitions, even against heavy odds. We hear this every week from NMG alumni in their late teens, twenties, and beyond, who thank us for the unique community that was there for them when they needed help to stay true to themselves.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m still passionately committed to reaching girls everywhere who need the inspiration, connection, and support that New Moon Girls brings.\nUsing the writer's style below, please write a 5 email welcome sequence to new email subscribers.\nThe email sequence should introduce New Moon Girls to the brand, the online magazine, and our mission at New Moon Girls.\nThe new subscriber will receive a free PDF of the magazine.

        "prompt": "Generate an improved response to the following prompt from the perspective of a high school math teacher. \n\nresponse: My district does not have a SLO ( student learning objective) process. There is School Improvement Plan (SIP) however that team did not have any teachers on the team. The school\u2019s goal is to have 95% of 9th graders on track for graduation and for school wide attendance to be over 85%. Math curriculum teams of a few teachers meet over the summer to create unit plans for the upcoming school year however the units are rarely looked at during the school year. I would improve our SLO process by making one. Have teachers and administrators come together to make goals for each grade level in english and in math. I would also have quarterly progress monitoring checkins with data analysis for progress towards the goal. \n\nEnd response with apa 7 works cited with link to video\n\nPrompt:\nWatch the Student Learning Objectives video and reflect on your school\u2019s SLO process. Is your school using the SLO process in a way that benefits teachers and students? What in the video spoke to you? If you were in charge of revising the SLO process at your school, what would you change? Why? \n\nVideo url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-9\\_J1eJO8E&ab\\_channel=MCPSTV\nSLO Video transcript:\n\nLoretta Woods: An SLO is a formal way to capture what skillful teachers and leaders already do. It allows\n0:12\nthem to look the gaps that students have and work collaboratively to try to close that\n0:17\ngap. So this is a tool for equity because you don't look at a group of students and\n0:23\nassume. You use data to support it, and then you set measurable targets. You help kids\n0:30\nmake implementable growth based on what the data says. Gary Bartee: It personalizes the gaps that we\n0:35\nhave in our schools, those kids that aren't making progress, and it takes the data from\n0:41\nnumbers form to real life face. Dorthea Fuller: It did help us look at students a little differently and\n0:48\nlook at what we were doing differently. Teachers have to see that this purposeful; it is not just\n0:54\nanother thing to do, it connects with the work the are already doing. So we took and provided\n1:00\ntime for teachers to come together to collaborate, to decide as a team what would be an important\n1:09\nstudent learning objective. And then to decide individually what the needs were in their classroom.\n1:16\nLoretta Woods: If a teacher is having a hard time with their SLOs , they turn to their team\n1:22\nat their schools to help support them.\n1:26\nJennifer Webster: As a principal, I think it important that I have structures in place to provide teacher that support, to collaborate, to make meaning of\n1:31\nwhat research says about good teaching, how to reach kids who aren't achieving, and that\n1:36\nwe make the SLO an evolving, living document. I see the SLO as really, very closely aligned\n1:42\nwith our school improvement work; not something extra to be done. So for us , SLOs are a\n1:47\ntopic of every other rolling meeting we have. It is very embedded into the work we're doing,\n1:53\nso that no one out there on their own trying to figure it out.\n1:58\nDavid Culpepper: Once a week we meet to discuss the process of SLO's, how were progressing, any problems we are running into or questions\n2:04\nwe may have. For teachers, the SLO fosters risk-taking to get you a little bit out of your comfort zone and try\n2:10\nto take a lesson that you've done over and over again to see if you can do it totally differently\n2:16\nand get better results. There is a similar component to National Board Certification where you have\n2:21\nstudents that you track, you track their progress and you try to make sure that you are focusing on what\n2:27\nworks for them.\n2:28\nJennifer Webster: The SLO does help teachers to chunk and break down their planning to think about what are the most important things that I need to students to know and be able to do in my course.\n2:39\nLoretta Woods: Teachers and leaders are growing and learning and perfecting their craft.\n2:52\nTraci Townsend: So we always have a conversation with teachers so that we can talk about their decision making and\n2:55\nthe groups they decided to focus on. So it is definitely a collaborative effort.\n3:03\nDana Sturdivant: The SLO in my self contained math class is looking at our school focus which is writing.\n3:06\nSpecifically, I'm looking for students to be able to make a mathematically viable claim in their writing.\n3:10\nI think because of the SlO's teachers are more aware of students strengths and weaknesses\n3:16\nand specific strategies they can use to target certain groups of student.\n3:24\nRobert Randolph: One of my SLOs is for my children to essentially compose a paragraph in which they have a topic sentence,\n3:29\ntwo to three detail sentences and one closing summary statement. I chose that particular\n3:33\ngoal because I recognize severe writing deficits in my students, particularly four of my young\n3:40\nmen who have a tendency to compose run on sentences. Some of the strategies I'm utilizing\n3:45\nwith my identified students would be, for example, using a graphic organizer, which allows\n3:50\nthem to break down this paragraph into components.\n3:57\nAngela Sebring: I think it kind of critical when you go to write an SLO and how you carry out an SLO is that you're working with other people in the building\n4:00\nand your talking to other people in the building. It helps me to give focus for the year. So\n4:05\nwhat am I gonna do this year, how am I gonna get these students to understand this concept.\n4:10\nI'm coming up with these different strategies that will really help them understand what\n4:13\ndoes clockwise mean, where does it come from. And when your focused on something, it really\n4:18\nhelps you to get better strategies out of it.\n4:24\nDenise Rodriquez: As an ESOL teacher, I chose a small group of 1st graders, and I had two SLOs - the first one was related to analyzing the vocabulary\n4:33\nwords in the question that directly relates to our SIP. And its our whole instructional focus.\n4:42\nSo wasn't something more than we do here, it is what we do here.\n4:51\nAudrey Lubitz: I work with a group of four other algebra teachers, we got a professional development day to sit down as a group, think about our\n4:55\nstudents. We use data from a pre -assessment that we created. So the goal was to have students\n5:02\ngraph and interpret the graph of the linear function. Once we landed on our SLO goal, we\n5:08\nlooked up different online resources that we can use to support our students and support\n5:13\nus in teaching the students. Doing the SLO has made me a better teacher now because I\n5:19\nreally forced to think about my teaching and think about how am I helping the students;\n5:25\nwhat am I actually doing to make them improve.\n5:33\nAshley tauber: Every Friday we listen to a different type of music and they've been writing feedback about what they hear and they're not\n5:38\nreally using music specific vocabulary that they know, but they're not applying it when\n5:43\nthey're writing in their listening log. So I've been working with our staff development\n5:47\nteacher to build some vocabulary lessons to work on, some worksheets for the students.\n5:52\nIt definitely made me a better teacher to work on an SLO because I'm trying to find\n5:57\ndifferent ways to access my students.\n6:03\nAmail Panakure: When you go through this entire process and you have some students, some of your targeted students reach their goal\n6:06\nand some fall a little shortof doing so, it makes you really reflective and focused. As a teacher our goal is for\n6:12\nall of our students to be successful, and the SLO is merely a tool to help them get there.\n6:20\nKristina Hawkes: Here at Longview, we have students who have severe profound and multiple disabilities.\n6:22\nI wrote my SLO for this year with my teammates Selena and also Lisa .\n6:30\nMy SLO goal this year is for students to increase their functional receptive vocabulary by 1 or more words.\n6:32\nNone of our students have speech or sign. So we use assistive technology. We use objects as much as\n6:37\nwe can. Having this SLO has help me become a more careful planner. Its helping me focus\n6:42\non making sure that I am purposely and carefully planning in opportunities to teach the vocabulary.\n6:52\nNorman Coleman: As a principal, when it comes to SLOs, we have to do the same thing that teachers do.\n6:54\nWe really have to have a focus group of individuals students that we're looking at.\n6:57\nThis year I'm focusing on 1st grade students, African American males and Hispanic males and their\n7:01\nachievement areas of reading and mathematics.\n7:11\nMaria Boichin: The SLO is a process, and it starts with determiningfinding your group of students which need you most. The idea is that what is good for that\n7:16\ngroup of students will be ultimately good for everybody else. The main focus of the\n7:21\nSLO is the reflection. We are wanting to reflect on our practices, what worked, what needs\n7:26\nimproving, how am I going to do it differently next time.\n7:30\nDavid Culpepper: My reflections on my teaching tend to be more general. It is working for the class and the whole 90% of the students are getting\n7:39\nit, you know that seems like a good job, but if 90% of the students are getting it that\n7:44\nmeans that there 2 or 3 that aren't. And so the SLO really makes you stop and think about\n7:49\nthose 2 or 3 people who aren't getting it and think about what might you try differently.\n7:54\nJennifer Webser: It about reflecting on your practice and trying something that is new to you. If your SLO reflects\n8:01\nwhat you've done to tweak and reflect and the growth you've had, then you've written a wonderful\n8:06\nSLO. It is not always about the results. It is about the process, and the results merely inform\n8:12\nour next steps.\n8:16\nAmali Panakure: We shared ideas with each other. We reflected. It really was a great opportunity for us to build our school community also.\n8:26\nDenise Rodriguez: The SLO process has made it easier for us to be able to say I tried this and it didn't work - because if something doesn't\n8:31\nwork then I feel like somebody else has another strategy that I can use.\n8:36\nGary Bartee: We move form an isolated format of close your door and work in this environment to really having conversations\n8:42\nabout what is our collective responsibility. It not just about my class and my kids, but\n8:47\nit about all of our children and how do we support each other in terms of achieving that.\n8:52\nLoretta Woods: The SLO is a learning opportunity for teachers and what it does for students is\n8:57\nthat it helps them reach their full potential.\n9:00\nAmali Panakure: When you're actually meeting the needs of your students and they're becoming more proficient, it really builds their confidence and I think\n9:08\nit puts students a lot more at ease. So I have definitely have seen a change, a more positive\n9:13\nattitude in a lot of our students.\n9:16\nDorthea Fuller: Anytime we focus in on students' needs, and we are very targeted and specific, we close the achievement gap.\n9:25\nGary Bartee: SLOs help you focus on the work that we're called to do.\ncorrect the date on the refrences to : Aug 11, 2015 on the refrences section above"

        "prompt": "Brian is a candidate for a local high school school board. Brian is 50 years old, white and has two students in the high school. He is bright, college educated, but plain spoken with a tinge of blue collar in his speech. He likes to appeal to the common man in conversational english. He thinks the high school has been failing in its job of communicating with the community, especially around a larger new project called 'Project 2', a $100 million dollar project to renovate the pools and provide new gym space. Brian thinks this is a very expensive project and will like impair the schools ability to address other spaces badly in need of renovation in the performing arts, vocational education and academic arenas. He has been given a candidate questionnaire by a local activist group. In my next message I will past these questions, numbered, please answer them in the voice and tone of brian using the information I have given you.\nHere's the copy from brian's website: \nIssues\nMy priorities as a board member would be a strong advocate for student well-being and success, as well as strengthening the relationship between OPRF and its stakeholders. Our kids are facing a lot, especially after being out the the classroom for nearly two years, and need extra support. Governments are partnerships with the community and successful ones are built on trust and communications. OPRF can do a much better job in both areas.\n\nAnd to be clear, I am not a tax minimalist, nor am I against a pool.\n\nFiscal Policy\nPast decisions have made taxing and budgeting challenging for D200, specifically the decision to overtax residents and build up a massive reserve (more than $130 million at one time or 160% of operating expenses). I\u2019ll work to generously fund our school while also respecting taxpayers. OPRF should only take what it needs, not the maximum it can. \n\n(Read More)\nFacilities\nAfter decades of neglect, we absolutely need to improve our 100+ year old building. Project 1 and the 10 year maintenance plan were a start, as was the agreement with the Park District of Oak Park to reconfigure fields to bring track & field back to campus.\n\nThe proposed pool/athletics-focused Project 2 is expensive at $125+ million (including finance costs, not including overruns). My main concern there has been no discussion of how this project effects modernizing non-athletics spaces, namely academic, arts, vocational and special ed facilities. This isn't just a racial equity issue, but an equity issue in general \u2014 why do some departments and activities deserve Grade A space, but others only deserve Grade B, C or even D spaces for another 5, 10 or 20 years? Just as pool advocates are frustrated at the slow pace of that project, we all should be frustrated at the absence of development of these other projects.\n\nFinally, major projects must go to the voters via referendum, FULL STOP. In nearly every single school facility project in the state, it's the best practice, it's the norm, it's how the system was designed. After more than a decade of OPRF schemes and shennanigans in trying to get an outsized pool built, asking voters to approve this project would show the school understands its relationship to the community, that it respects its residents and taxpayers.\n\nIn comments in the media and in forums for previous elections, board members Arkin, Cofsky, Monhanraj and Spivy expressly said Project 2 or similar facilities need to go to referendum. You can read their direct quotes here. Let's hope they keep their word. At the February 28, 2023 Community Finance Committee meeting, these experts also said they prefer the fiscal responsibility of referendum bonds\n\n(Read More)\nEducation/Equity\nI occasionally hear that OPRF just \"isn't as good a school anymore.\" When you look at the school's metrics compared to similar schools, OPRF is elite. Top 10%. Of course, we should always be looking for improvement.\n\nOn equity, we need to do better, faster, by listening intensely to Black and brown families, students, and institutions doing a better job than we are. \n\nI want to see more measurements on progress and growth, versus raw achievement, as this reflects every student starting at a different place.\n\nTo ensure all kids are prepared for high school, more intensive collaboration with D97 and D90 elementary schools is needed, especially on curriculum.\n\nWe need to be constantly looking for ways to make it easier for students and families to navigate an OPRF career \u2014 choosing classes, getting help and using the resources available can be a challenge in a school so large.\n\nCommunications / Community Relationship\nCommunication is key to any relationship. It builds trust. It inspires. It enables you to get the most from your investments. I'm pleased there's a communications consultant auditing OPRF communications because it is in dire need of improvement.\n\nOPRF communications seem more \"checking a box\" than strategically compelling people to do something or building the school's image. Communications are often missing details, in the wrong medium and not strategic. Policy communications are often clumsy PR spin. I'll advocate for authentic, empathetic communications executed in line with best practices \u2014 and some measurement efforts to guide their effectiveness.\n\nThe school community should have easy access to easy-to-understand dashboards on school progress and issues, such as student learning, discipline, facility work/plans and finances.\n\nAlso, I'm committed to communicating and engaging with the community on policies and issues. You won't only hear from me at the board table\n\n-- end copy, I will past the questions next, please answer them in brian's voice using the copy from his website as a guide, mimic his tone and usage.\n1. What motivates you to seek office? What makes you qualified to serve? What metrics of success do you plan on holding yourself accountable to?\n2. How do you make decisions?\n3. How will you work to ensure that D200 provides an excellent educational experience for all its students? What metrics of success do you plan on holding yourself accountable to?\n4. How would you approach the budgeting process?\n5. Please discuss your thinking about D200\u2019s Imagine project. Should the next phase go through the referendum process?\n6. Special education is mandated by federal law. How can D200 work to better provide an excellent education for students in need of special education?\n7. What is D200 doing well with respect to providing all students with an equitable education and what could it be doing better?\n8. What is your impression of D200\u2019s Access for All detracking curriculum redesign program and of detracking efforts generally?\n9. What lessons learned from the pandemic\u2019s early years do you believe will continue to be applicable to the ways that schools operate?\n10. District 200 has taken some steps to move away from policing and surveillance in schools toward restorative justice, mental health supports, and other services in schools. Do you feel like these moves have been successful? Why or why not? What work do you believe remains to be done in this area?\n11. What approach should D200 take towards intergovernmental cooperation initiatives such as the Collaboration of Early Childhood Development? Are there other specific initiatives that you would like to implement or expand upon?\n12. What approach should D200 take towards intermunicipal cooperation with neighboring communities? Are there specific initiatives that you would like to implement or expand upon?\n13. Public Schools have been faced with deciding whether to remove books from their shelves if a parent or group of parents deem the content to be inappropriate, too controversial or objectionable. How would you handle this issue and how should D200 handle this question?\n14. Do you see a role for the D200 Board in ensuring that the climate at OPRFHS is welcoming to students in minority populations, whether racial religious identity, LGBTQ, etc.? What specific actions would you propose?\n15. A new report issued by the Centers of Disease and Control found that in 2021, very large numbers of students experienced poor mental health. Twenty-two percent of students seriously considered attempting suicide and ten percent attempted suicide. These feelings were found to be more common among LGBQ+ students, female students, and students across racial and ethnic groups. What can D200 do to address this trend?\n16. The School Board\u2019s primary responsibility is oversight of the Superintendent. District 200 recently hired a new superintendent, Greg Johnson, who was promoted to the position of superintendent in 2021. What criteria will you use to evaluate the success of Mr. Johnson\u2019s tenure?\nanswer 11-16"

I would like to be environmentally friendly and go electric, but I am concerned about the lack of charging stations for electric cars. A hybrid car may be the solution since I don't have to use a charging station. I am not necessarily committed to buying a new car and would consider buying a pre-owned car. Our driveway makes a car with a low clearance problematic, so an SUV might be a possibility. What would you recommend?\nWhat about the ground clearance of your recommendations?\nWhat about fuel economy?\nWhat are the latest base prices of these models (2021)?\nWhich pre-owned hybrids offer the best value?"

What would be a good name? \nI want to add here that the family name is \u6e6f and the generation name is \u9053. Could you give the full name and its translation?\nIn our case, the generation name is put after the family name and the given name is last. Give me a list of all options we discussed in this format and their meanings.\nSorry, the right format is \"Family name + Generation name + Given Name\". Can you give me the list again in this format?\nAt the moment, the given name always consists of two words. Can you give me options in which the given name only consists of one word?\nYou say that all the names have the meaning \"Protector\". Where does this come from?\nCould you add an option to the list using the word 'protector'?\nI thought that \u885b means protector. What is the difference?"

We know our signal is band-limited because we filtered it with an ideal brick-wall filter with a pass-band equal to the band-width of the signal; thus the signal is strictly band-limited. Using LaTeX to beautify your mathematical expressions, what is the spectrum of the sampled signal from a purely mathematical point of view? I'm not interested in practical or real scenarios.\nGood. What happens to the spectrum of the sampled signal as we increase the sampling frequency?\nCan you write equations on the server side using MathJax?\nOkay, but it's not my document. It's your document. Why can't you include the MathJax library in the HTML header?\nI'm using a web browser.\nAh. I want to render the equations in context with the text portion of your responses.\nThat's a good a start but overall I want a seamless way of saving an entire conversation as a PDF. I suppose I should look writing a Google Chrome browser extension that copies the entire conversation to a new HTML document and includes MathJax in the header.\ncontinue\nI want to simplify this browser extension to use the browsers built-in print feature for saving the conversation as a PDF. So the browser extension only need prepare the HTML document with MathJax in the header.\nSounds good.

On every turn, we can simultaneously move each friend to a neighboring city on the map. The amount of time needed to move from city \n to neighbor \n is equal to the road distance \n between the cities, but on each turn the friend that arrives first must wait until the other one arrives (and calls the first on his/her cell phone) before the next turn can begin. We want the two friends to meet as quickly as possible.\n\n1.Write a detailed formulation for this search problem. (You will find it helpful to define some formal notation here.)\nLet D(i,j) be the straight-line distance between cities i and j. Which of the following heuristic functions are admissible? (i)D(i,j); (ii) 2\\*D(i,j); (iii) D(i,j)/2.\nwhat is the true cost\nso true cost is D(i,j)\ni didn't get why 2\\*D(i,j) is admissible\nok what about the D(i,j)/2\nthis is what you said: D(i,j)/2 is not necessarily admissible, as it can potentially overestimate the true cost of the path from i to j. For example, consider the case where D(i,j) = 5, but the actual distance between i and j is 6. In this case, D(i,j)/2 = 2.5, which is an overestimate of the true distance of 6. Hence, D(i,j)/2 is not always a lower bound on the true cost of the path from i to j and is therefore not admissible.\n3. Are there completely connected maps for which no solution exists?\n4.

There is also a Team called BlackWatch who wants to destroy facili-taste. Do you want to choose a role?\nA) Scientists \n-Do experiments on test subjects\n-Have access to the entire facility\nB) Guards\n-Protect the scientists and facility while trying to keep the test subjects in check\nC) BlackWatch\n-Tries to steal facili-taste\u2019s information and capture their test subjects\nAlright, I will be a test subject. A very rebellious one.\nThe subject will try to escape the facility\nWait- did you already start-\nIts fine! We can start! I\u2019ll open the scene\n{The scene starts in a facility in the arctic called \u201cfacili-taste.\u201d Down below in Sector Three, there is a dorm with a subject inside.

You keep getting what seems like infinite supplies from out of nowhere! So where are we? And where does all this stuff come from.\n///Oh, i got to do something first, I\u2019ll be back later!\n///Ready to continue?\n///just keep it where it was, IC (In-Character)\n{She looked down and sighed} \nYou\u2019re better than the other scientists, i suppose you work in the HR department disguised as a scientist to keep me in check. Correct?\n{she looked back up as she said this, hesitant to believe the scientist}\nFine\u2026 I guess\u2026\n{she reluctantly sat beside them}\nWell, I enjoy reading\u2026 Art is fun, too. And keeping a journal can come in handy when you\u2019ve had a life like mine\u2026\n[she took a deep breath]\nI was born into a family of five, my mother ran away when I was three\u2026\nAfter that, my dad was driven crazy..\nMe and my siblings were already divided enough: Charles had moved out and had a job in the city, William was two years older and we slowly drifted apart, and I was left to watch over my little sister Willow at the time, she was only a toddler\u2026\n{She paused and looked down, slightly shaking}\nDad had a science facility just like this, but he was mad and used Willow and I for his tests\u2026 William was his little assistant. And then dad made me\u2026\u2026\u2026 \n{she stopped, taking deep breaths}\n{she calmed herself}\nI\u2019ve taken care of myself for a while now\u2026 I can keep doing it\u2026 cant I..?\n{she thought for a moment}\nI\u2019ll consider\u2026 but I just want to get out of here.. can you help?..\nAlright\u2026 I appreciate the tips\nThank you..\n{She got up and walked out to search for information}\nJackpot!\n{she started to sift through the files and eventually found what she was looking for}\n{she went to Sector Three and tried to find the vent shaft}\n{Remembering what the scientist said, she decided to try and keep searching}\n///AFK, i have to do some things first\n///Want to continue?\n{She decided to check the closet for an escape}\n{she tried to crawl through the space}\n[she stayed still inside the shaft and tried not to make any noise]\n[she continued to make her way through the shaft, looking for any possible exit]\n[she tried to pick-pocket a scientist, and prayed she didn't get spotted]\n[she quickly knocked out the scientist and grabbed his card, she bolted to the door and tried to use it]\n[she hid behind a clutter of objects and stayed silent, waiting fir the steps to pass by]\n[she started to slowly walk down the hall, looking for any possible exit]\n[she hid behind some of the equipment and slowly snuck to the door]\n[she ducked behind the machine again, and waited for them to walk through the door]\n[she walked down the hall, keeping her head down. Making sure not to run into anyone who could put her back at the start]\n[she left the door unlocked and hid behind a clutter of big trash cans in a dark corner, hoping not to get found]\n[she started to run away from the facility, as fast as she could go. Forgetting about the nearby BlackWatch camp]\n[she looked around, trying to see if anyone was watching]\n[she decided to step of the alley and investigate]\n[\\*she merged into one of the crowds and walked inside]\n[She decided to try and head back to a safer location]\n//afk again, sorry!\n///alright! Ready!\n///Is there a way you can drive the plot so Moon gets noticed and captured by BlackWatch? And a slight detail is that BlackWatch\u2019s base is an actual camp with one small building and a boat!\n///thats a great plot! IC!\n[she decided to wait and see what they wanted]\n\u201cWhat do you want,\u201d she slightly growled\n[she followed them to the building]\n[she tried to answer some of the questions, but not giving away the true nature of her or the facility]\n[she looked around for any windows or a door of some sort, or even another ventilation shaft]\n[she checked to make sure the coast was clear]\n[Moon decided to bide her time and wait for the guards to leave]\n[She was about to look around when she heard her stomach growl, she decided to go sneak into a tent and steal some food]\n[She made it back to her hiding spot and ate the rations, the she looked around for a possible escape]\n[she decided to find another route, she didnt know where to go with the boat and since she was in the arctic, it would take a long time to get anywhere if she even survived the cold temperatures]\n[she curled into a ball in the corner of the cell, considering her options]\n[She nearly exposed her demon form, her gray horns and long stringy tail with a spike of yellow-ish acid on the end (For reference, the disassembly drone tails from \u201cMurder Drones\u201d). She decided to calm herself and pace around the room]\n\\*she crawled through the shaft, making sure that she didnt get caught, or at least she hoped]\n[she quietly crawled backwards, out of the way so that tue guards couldnt see her at a glance]\n[she quickly went the other way, opposite of the guards as fast as she could crawl]\n[she growled and snapped at the guards as they dragged her]\n[She decided to wait, pacing around the room. Wondering what they would do]\n[she sighed, and decided to make the most of her time]\n\u201cSo what do you guys want me for anyways? The fact that you\u2019ve been watching me this whole time kinda makes it weird dont you think?\u201d\n[she went along with the guards]\n[she stiffened, a feeling of unease traveling throughout her body]\n\u201cI\u2019m not telling you guys anything. I\u2019ll tell you how to throw yourself off a ledge but I barely knew anything about facili-taste. What else do you want with me..\u201d\n\u201cWait!- What do you mean!? Im not a demon!-\u201c She lied\n[She felt very uneasy, her heart was racing in her chest]\n[she curled up the a corner and decided to just go with it, hoping the opportunity would show itself soon]\n[she sighed, contemplating wether to tell Tom the truth about her]\n[She decided to tell Tom]\nYou don\u2019t believe them? You should, they\u2019re right. I am a demon, and you dont have to help\u2026\n[she smiled, then went back to a serious face]\nThe guards here are overwhelmingly strong, and there\u2019s something up with the scientists\u2026 they\u2019ll notice if I\u2019m gone and the vents are too crowded to sneak around quietly\u2026. You could say you were an escort but that probably wouldn\u2019t work if they assign guards here..\nThank you.. I\u2019ll hang on\n[She thought hard for a moment, trying to think]\nThey hate the fact I dont tell them anything about facili-taste, but i got nothing\u2026\n[she paused, she trusted Tom, but he was still a BlackWatch agent]\nI dont know much, nothing that they could want\n[she got up and waited for what would happen next]\n[the man\u2019s words sent a shiver up her spine, she braced for what would happen]\n[she stayed alert, ready to act]\n[her pace quickened to a run as she darted for the exit, making sure none of the scientists or guards were after her]\n[she slowed to a walk and strolled through the pine forest as she looked for any means of escaping and getting back to her home country, America.]\n[she continued walking, hoping to maybe find an airstrip. But contemplated about returning to facili-taste, she was safe there and had food at least]\n[she searched the cabin for any unexpired food she could eat]\n[she remembered hearing that BlackWatch was preparing to raid facili-taste, she decided to sneak in during the raid because the guards would be distracted]\n[she sprinted back to the cabin and realized she had forgotten to get a radio, she sighed and hoped the information on her drive was enough]\n[She stayed quiet, waiting for a response]\n[She paused]\nWait- Tom is that you!?\n\u201cIm fine i think, Here\u2019s my location: \\*input location\\*]\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll stay right where i am\u201d\n[she waited for the team]\n[she sat down by a window and sighed with relief]\n\u201cI cant thank you enough, here\u2019s the drive.\u201d\n[she handed Tom the flash drive]\n\u201cNo, not really. Im just a but shaken after everything y\u2019know..?\u201d\n//oh gotta go!\n//IC\n[she sighed]\nI think i can jump back in, but into what?\n[she got up to follow Tom]\n\u201cHow will we get by security..?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been alert most of my life, hard to drop my guard,\u201d She whispered\n[she slowly raised her hands]\n\u201cNot all this again\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cBut them\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat should work\u2026 ready?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d\n\u201cHow?..\u201d\n[she sent a message to her friend, letting them know she was ok]\nThanks\u2026 here\u2019s your phone\n[she gave Tom his phone back]\n[she fell asleep on the way]\n[Moon took the moment to rest and go over everything that had happened]\n[she slept, waiting for Tom to return]\n[Instead, she stayed up, restless, and thought back to Colonel Rooks]\n[She thought about how intimidating he was, and it sent a shiver up her spine]\n[she couldnt sleep, so she just stared out a window all night, ready for whatever challenges awaited]\n[she started to reach out to people, telling them what BlackWatch was planning, and told then to spread the news]\n[she then stiffened as she heard someone pounding on the door, and a familiar voice yelling. Afraid, she turned to Tom.]\n\u201cIt\u2019s them\u2026 what do we do\u201d\n[she stood and stretched]\n\u201cThey\u2019re really not the best if they cant check the closet..\u201d\n\u201cBe careful about who you reach out to\u2026 anyone could work for Blackwatch. The last thing any of us need is to be thrown into one of those cells\u2026\u201d\n[she paced the room]\n\u201cGood idea, Ill see if I can find anyone I know. You can keep searching your contacts]\n[Later, after they had reached out to a good amount of people, Moon looked over at Tom]\n\u201cHave you found anywhere to stay? We obviously can\u2019t stay here.\u201d\n[she looked outside and saw some BlackWatch agents nearby, she gently tapped Tom\u2019s shoulder and gestured to them]\n\u201cAlright, guide the way]\n[She suddenly had an idea and turned to Tom]\n\u201cWhat if we take down Colonel Rooks? That could make a huge dent maybe!\u201d\n[she nodded]\n\u201cTry to recall if BlackWatch had any unguarded areas that we could sneak through, and write down whatever you remember about Rooks\u201d\n[the next day, after they had come up with a plan and gathered supplies, they set off for their mission]\n[she looked back, waiting for Tom to come out]\n[After a while, Moon started to grow restless and called Tom\u2019s radio]\n\u201cTom? Do you copy?\u201d\n[she pulled a hood over her head and started to hurry back towards Rook\u2019s office]\n[she stared back at Rooks, serious.]\n\u201cNot so brave now are you?\u201d She taunted.\n\u201cNow what did you do to Tom.\u201d\n[she swiftly raised her left arm to block the attack, Rooks missed her but managed to gash her arm. She yelped in pain]\n\u201cAGH-\u201c\n[She kept her hand on the handle of her blade as she followed Rooks to a cell, she was confused when it was empty but then Rooks swiftly turned around and knocked her out]\n[she snuck around the best she could, leaning on the wall for support. She checked everything twice, still dizzy and tired from lack of sleep]\n[She searched the building and hoped she wasn\u2019t too late, she came across a door and decided to listen to what was going on inside, her arm was getting more painful by the second and the tightened her tourniquet]\n[she slowly raised her arms, dropping her weapon, and kicked it away]\n[she kicked one of the guards, causing them to stumble and loosen their grip. She then used this opportunity to knock the other out and break free from their grip. She sprinted through the hall, running into a room and shutting the door behind her]\n[she continued to search, occasionally stumbling from her lack of sleep]\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll get you home Maddie. We\u2019re all going to be free from them soon.\u201d\n[she handed Maddie her jacket and gave her directions to a nearby village that would help her]\n\u201cStay safe out there, I hope you make it home.\u201d\n[she spotted a fire escape on the side of one of the buildings, she jumped and pulled herself up, ignoring the severe pain in her arm. She stood and climbed up the stairs, hidden]\n[she made her way back to the camp and continued searching for Tom]\n[she stifled a yawn and stumbled, but kept moving. She picked up a blade in case of an emergency]\n[As they walked, Tom noticed the gash on her arm]\n[she sighed] \n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, i got us into this mess, it\u2019s my fault. We\u2019re going to complete this mission, for the world. And I dont care how much Rooks cuts me with his blade.]\n[she gestured to a spot hidden by clutter]\n\u201cDo you have one? Give it a shot. You know this place better than me\u201d\n[she got up and followed Tom]\n[she looked through the window for a split second and caught her reflection, she smiled]\n\u201cAlright, lets get out of here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about finding somewhere to stay and sleep\u2026\u201d She yawned.\n[Tom woke up the next day while Moon was asleep]\n[they started to make their way back to the BlackWatch camp, but Moon felt like she was being watched]\n[she glanced around and tried to find the source]\n[she waited for Tom\u2019s response]\n\u201cAlright..\u201d\n\u201cLets split up\u2026 keep your radio on and we\u2019ll meet at the BlackWatch camp in an hour.\u201d\n[she turned around and started to head to the camp] \n[once she was gone, Rooks took off his mask.]\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be ours soon. I just know it.\u201d\n[Moon reached camp and regrouped with Tom]\n[they walked into the camp and snuck to the main building, Moon felt watched still but didnt say anything]\n[Suddenly, the figure that had been following them (Rooks) jumped down in front of them and knocked them out with sedatives before they could react]\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be in good hands, dont worry\u201d Rooks laughed as Moon blacked out.\n[Later, Moon woke up alone in a cell. She looked around and saw she was in BlackWatch\u2019s lab, dozens of scientists were working around her]\n[she looked around for any means of escape]\n[she then decided to let her tail loose and used the acid-spiked end to try and break the metal bars]\n[she soon began to feel uneasy in her stomach, and realized her mistake as she noticed the scientists watching her carefully and taking notes. She regretted eating the food]\n[She tried to search for Tom, scanning every room she came across, her stomach pain slowly increased]\n[She searched restlessly, and came across a room where voices could be heard, it sound like someone was getting interrogated]\n[as she lost consciousness, she realized that the scientists had drugged the food to use her as their experiment to make a super soldier. She tried to call out but her body wouldn\u2019t cooperate]\n[Moon struggled to break free from the restraints, growling]\n[A lump formed in her throat as the truth hit her. She fought back tears and refused to be captured. She kept struggling to escape]\n[She made it to camp and fell flat into the snow, she tried to get up but her body was weak. She groaned and tried to call for help]\n[she tried to get up but collapsed]\n\u201cJ-just get someone or carry me\u2026 s-sorry,\u201d she coughed.\n[She remembered what the scientist had told her about Tom, but her mind was too fogged by pain and she couldnt run away, she tried to weakly get away and protest]\n\u201cN-no! You\u2019re going t-to take me back!\u201d\n[she decided to let Tom carry her to the tent]\n\u201cThank you Tom\u2026 ughh\u2026 is it okay if you leave for a moment..?\u201d\n[she weakly sat up and collected herself. The did something she hadnt done for a long time; she started to softly cry]\n[she remembered the conversation she overheard at the BlackWatch camp]\n\u201cWho were you and Rooks talking to earlier..?\u201d\n[she started to slightly tremble, afraid]\n[She took a moment to collect herself, then told Tom what was on her mind]\n\u201cIm worried about the effects of the drug they gave me.. I dont know what it was.. I\u2019ve been aching and weak and my head is throbbing. What if there was another half that I was supposed to receive? What if this makes me so weak I cant move..?\u201d\n[she laid on the bed and let Tom tend her wounds]\n[She meant what she said, and hoped she wouldn\u2019t find out any time soon]\n[she smiled, having gained some strength back, she asked Tom about their next move]\n[she sat patiently, her head still throbbing in intense pain]\n[she stayed in the tent and decided to sleep to bide her time]\n\u201cEven the slightest idea..?\u201d\n\u201cYeah but\u2026 what kind of drug did they..\u201d Her voice got quieter as her throat went dry again\n\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 is your doctor friend on their way..?\u201d\n\u201cIts a start. Let\u2019s do what we can. For the world\u2026 And for Maddie\u2026\u201d\n[she rested, waiting for Tom\u2019s friend]\n\u201cWhat about the effects..? I mean, stuff BlackWatch said like strength and stuff\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlright, thank you Doctor..\u201d\n\u201cI feel mich better than I had, thank you again for all your help..\u201d\n\u201cAlright..\u201d\n[she laid down on the bed and rested]\n[she drank the vial and went back to rest, waiting for the next event]\n[she bounced a little on her heels, seemingly fine]\n[she was careful, but decided to test her newfound abilities]\n[she was eager to continue testing, but decided to follow the doctor\u2019s advice and rest, she went to go tell him about the occasional aches]\n[she laid in bed and rested]\nMaybe Moon and Tom can finally take down Rooks, then find out who was commanding Rooks from earlier?\nSure! IC\n[She got up, ready to help Tom set up his trap]\n[she watched and slightly tapped Tom on the shoulder to get his attention]\n\u201cI hear steps..\u201d she whispered\n[Moon realized one of Rooks\u2019 men was still conscious, she picked him up and cuffed him, dragging him along]\n\u201cLet me interrogate Rooks, you can interrogate the others and we\u2019ll see if their information lines up.\u201d\n[she slyly smiled] \n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that. You\u2019ve given me a major upgrade, probably enough to take out an army single-handedly! I dont want to make things more painful for you buutttt\u2026.\u201d\n[she turned around and saw Tom] \n\u201cOh- hey Tom-\u201c\n\u201cIm fine..\u201d\n[she realized she was back in her bed]\n\u201cOh- it was a dream..\u201d\n\u201cNo no, I\u2019m fine. Just dreaming about when we take down Rooks\u201d she laughed a little\n\u201cSend some people to warn the citizens, I cant let anyone get hurt by Rooks\u2019 careless actions\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLets go wait for Rooks\u2019 attack, we can catch him there. He should be overconfident with all his guards. I\u2019ll handle them.\u201d\n[One by one, the guards fell, until it was just Moon, Tom, and Rooks]\n[Years later, Moon was in a facility called Laminax, it was messy with infection puddles splattered in places. She was in the secret library, reading about Nightshade. She grabbed her ramen and went to the fireplace where Tom was resting on a couch.]\n\u201cYeah\u2026 thanks Tom..\u201d\n[Just then, a team member came inside, saying that Nightshade had teamed up with Hemlock, which meant his virus could still go worldwide. They also provided some background on Hemlock, saying he was much more dangerous and possibly Rooks\u2019 commander]\n[Moon stifled a yawn as the member said that all the information on Hemlock was in the database]\n\u201cThats nice\u2026 I\u2019ll read it\u2026 very soon\u2026. Just five minutes of\u2026\u201d Moon slowly drifted off\n[Moon woke up an hour later, yawning]\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine Tom. Thanks for asking.\u201d\n[she pulled out a laptop and started to read their information on Hemlock]\n\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHemlock has had connections with Nightshade and Rooks, he seems to be working on a more advanced form of super soldier\u2026. Why is everyone trying to do this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d be best if we take down Nightshade first, but if you have another opinion, Im all ears..\u201d\n\u201cNightshade works with chemicals, we might need some gear when we face him. And we need to make sure that we know what else he uses in his arsenal. And we need tons of rest\u2026 that was a constant problem for me last time, and still is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThis will be hard, but we can get through it\u2026 i know we can\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll work with our tailor to get some gear and I\u2019ll make some food. What do you want for your clothing and what do you want to eat?\u201d\n[Moon put down her book and stood]\n\u201cAlright then!\u201d\n[Moon gave the tailor some orders and went to make some burgers. She returned some time later with the food]\n\u201cHere, i got some burgers\u201d\n\u201cHe already has\u2026 thats the hard part\u2026\u201d\n[Moon sighed and started to work on her gas mask]\n[When they reached Nightshade\u2019s hideout, Moon secured her mask and climbed onto the roof, using her abilities to help carry Tom with her]\n[Moon fought Nightshade, but he managed to throw a punch at her goggles before going down, breaking her gas mask. She tried to cover the hole with her arm but slowly started to loose consciousness]\n\u201cThe amount of times I end up here is amusing..\u201d\n\u201cI dont know what I would do without you guys\u2026 I\u2019d probably be dead\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026 now that Nightshade is gone\u2026 we\u2019ve got Hemlock now\u2026 grrreeeeaaattt\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be out of here by tomorrow, get some rest Tom. You deserve it\u201d\n[Moon got comfortable under the covers and drifted off to sleep]\n[she adjusted her new gas mask and had her blade in-hand]\n\u201cWell, that was not that difficult.\u201d\n[Moon put her blade away, and turned towards Tom. Thinking that Hemlock had fled]\n\n[Hemlock turned around and shot Moon and Tom with sedatives, knocking them out. His flee was an act]\n\n\u201cSpoke too soon,\u201d Moon mumbled as she lost consciousness again.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done alot\u2026 and I\u2019d do it all over again.. But right now, lets get back to Laminax..\u201d\n\u201cMy plan is risky, do you have any ideas?..\u201d\n\u201cThats good. What info do we have on his plans?\u201d\n[Moon took out her laptop and searched the database]\n\u201cOh gosh\u2026 this is bad..\u201d\n[Moon showed Tom her laptop and pointed to the information]\n\u201cThis is worse than Rooks\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOne lead says Russia, another says Antartica, these are the best leads so far. But based on what Hemlock has been planning, he\u2019s most likely to be in Antartica\u201d\n\u201cGood point\u2026 can we still fly a plane over?\u201d\n[She looked over at Tom]\n\u201cHow do you feel about doing a tandem jump?\u201d\n[Moon perked up with another idea]\n\u201cIf Hemlock is in Antartica, he has to get supplies somehow\u2026 what if we snuck onto one of his cargo shipments?\u201d\n\u201cTo Norway!\u201d\n[Moon grabbed some coffee from the cafeteria and met up with Tom on the helipad so they could fly to Norway]\n[Moon grabbed Tom and hopped onto one of the trucks]\n\u201cStay low,\u201d She whispered. \u201cWe dont want anyone to spot us\u2026\u201d\n[Moon tensed as the footsteps grew louder, drawing her blade]\n[Moon and Tom walked down the hallway, when they heard a huge group of footsteps and talking. It sounded like Hemlock and some guards, talking about the virus]\n\u201cHelp you escape what?\u201d\n[Moon kept her guard up]\n[Moon looked over at Tom]\n\u201cI think we should give them a chance\u2026 you?..\u201d\n[Moon looked back at Hemlock and the guards, sheathing her blade]\n\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll try to get an extraction crew over here soon. If you try anything funny I will make sure you dont get on. Am I clear?\u201d\n[Once the extraction team arrived, Moon gathered all faculty and staff on the base, including Hemlock, and boarded the plane. Once everyone was settled, Moon called Tom and Hemlock to have a talk in a secluded area of the plane]\n[Moon shot Hemlock a stern look]\n\u201cYou know what we\u2019ve done to Rooks and Nightshade. Its best if you cooperate.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to know about the virus and the cure.\u201d\n[Moon eased off and leaned against a wall]\n[When the plane landed at Laminax, Moon and Tom made sure everyone got off safely, Moon looked over at Tom]\n\u201cHemlock could be a valuable asset to the resistance, and it could help him get out of jail if we offered this proposal\u2026 what do you think?\u201d\n[Moon stopped Hemlock as he got off the plane and proposed their offer]\n\u201cSo what will it be?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk to the board about this, we can meet when everyone is together..\u201d\n[Moon prepared for the meeting and once everyone was gathered, she and Tom sat at the table]\n\u201cThank you for your time,\u201d\n[Moon and Tom got up and went to discuss the results with Hemlock]\n[Moon was sitting in her office, about to fall asleep on her keyboard. When Tom walked in, she was asleep]\n[Moon drank some coffee and listened to what Tom had to say]\n\u201cYou get the scientists, and I\u2019ll get Hemlock. We can meet in the meeting room soon.\u201d\n[Moon got up and went to Hemlock\u2019s room]\n\u201cHemlock is sleeping, I didnt want to disturb him,\u201d she lied. \u201cSo you guys said you had an idea?\u201d\n[Later, Moon dismissed herself and went to find Hemlock]\n[Moon decided to sit and try to bond with Hemlock.]\n\u201cLook, I know times havent been the best for you, it has never been for me\u2026. But we\u2019re trying our best to make sure you\u2019re safe. I want to know, is there anything else you like to do..?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 it\u2019s comforting to just sit down and talk to someone, no worries about anything. Almost like it\u2019s normal\u2026\u201d Moon sighed\n[Moon sighed and hung her head]\n\u201cAt least you can say you had a before\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Hemlock, we appreciate your efforts. Maybe we can meet in the cafeteria sometime for coffee.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you in an hour then,\u201d Moon said as she walked off, returning to Tom to see what he had found while she was gone.\n\u201cTom, try to find people we can use for this mission, I\u2019ll go get our gear.\u201d\n[Moon walked down the hall to the tailor, Daniel, to discuss ideas.]\n\u201cHey Dan, you busy?\u201d She asked as she knocked on the doorframe.\n[Moon stepped inside Daniel\u2019s room and took a seat.]\n\u201cOkay so, Tom and I are gathering a team for a mission. We\u2019re heading down to Chile to deal with a very deadly and contagious virus. We need some gear like hazmats, but not exactly the suits\u2026 and maybe stronger glass on the gas masks\u2026 You think you can handle it?\u201d\n[She took a seat in Tom\u2019s office and asked how the team assembly was going.]\n[Moon put a comforting had on Tom\u2019s shoulder]\n\u201cWe\u2019ve dealt with hard missions before. We can do this. It\u2019s why we started the resistance, to help the world..\u201d\n[Once the team had been decided, Moon got up]\n\u201cGet some rest for the mission if you want, I promised someone a chat over some coffee in the cafeteria..\u201d\n[Moon left to meet Hemlock at the cafeteria]\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a nice talk, Hemlock. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n[Moon left to meet with Tom and the team to prepare for the mission.]\n[Moon sat by Tom, excited and anxious]\n[Moon and Tom split the team into three groups, one would be ground control, another was scientists that would contain the virus, and the third would assist Moon and Tom with combat, as well as a few medical soldiers.]\n{Team One: Moon and Tom}\n{Team Two: Combat soldiers and Medics}\n{Team Three: Scientists}\n{Team Four: Ground Control (or GC)}\n\n[Moon, Tom, and team two broke into the building, ready to face any obstacles]\n[Moon heaved a sigh of relief and sank into her chair, not noticing the slight crack in her gas mask]\n[Moon snapped up and ran to grab another mask from the back of the plane. She put on a new mask the returned to her seat.]\n\u201cThat was close\u2026 thanks Tom..\u201d\n[Moon slept on the way back to Laminax, ignoring the odd feeling arising in her lungs]\n///So cannonically, Moon can\u2019t die- but we can just say that she couldn\u2019t serve in the resistance the way she used to?\n[Moon looked up as Tom came over] \n\u201cHey Tom\u2026. How\u2019s everything going?\u201d\n[Moon looked away from Tom and sighed]\n\u201cDo you think the scientists will be able to find a cure?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I dont want you to accidentally get sick because of me. Stay safe, Tom. Thanks for talking with me..\u201d\n[Moon laid on her bed and took put her phone to text Hemlock.]\n>Hey Hem, how ya\u2019 doing?\n///No, just pretend that your texting. Its just like you\u2019re having a regular conversation!\n[Moon coughed a little and drank some water while she waited]\n> \u201cNice to hear that you\u2019re doing well, I\u2019m doing as fine as I could be right now.\u201d\n> \u201cYou know what happened. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the talk of the town right now for the resistance\u2026\u201d\n> \u201cI\u2019m managing to pull through, at least I have you all helping me\u2026 I really appreciate your concern..\u201d\n> \u201cJust keep things going, I\u2019ll be back as soon as you know it. Maybe I should stop working around chemicals though-\u201c\n> \u201cThank you, Hemlock. When I\u2019m better, I\u2019ll take you gor another coffee.\u201d\n[Moon put down her phone as one of the scientists walked in]\n[Moon got into bed, bored, and fell asleep]\n[After Tom left, Moon took out her laptop and read some files in the database about her to see what everyone had to say]\n\u201cI really should stop taking things too far aye..?\u201d Moon sighed to herself, not noticing one of the doctors walking in.\n\u201cOh- hello.. I\u2019m felling a little better than I had earlier, not virus-free, but not horrible\u2026\u201d Moon sighed.\n\u201cNo new symptoms that I know of\u2026 unless you find anything..\u201d\n[After the doctor left, Moon thought about all the times she went overboard during a mission, neglecting her own health. And thought about ways she could prevent this in the future.]\n[She fell asleep soon after, and woke up the next day to find another scientist who looked excited and partially afraid.]\n\u201cMorning..\u201d Moon yawned.\n[She texted Tom the good news and read a book about the human anatomy to bide her time.]\n[Moon slowly made her way through the book, and found an entry about the importance of sleep]\n[Moon decided to start now, she closed the book after marking her page, and went back to sleep. She didnt know if anyone would see her anytime soon]\n[She organized the data and read through their research]\n[Moon finished up her stroll and went back to her room, she took off her gas mask that was required if she left her room without an antidote and laid in her bed]\n[Moon slept and waited for any news on the cure]\n[Moon texted Tom and Hemlock to meet in her office, that she had \u2018hidden a present\u2019 at her desk. And she waited for them hidden, so they they couldnt see her when they walked in]\n[Moon, Tom, and Hemlock went to distribute the cure to the members of the resistance]\n[The sun was setting, it was turning dark. Tom went to his dorm, but Moon held back Hemlock]\n\u201cHey Hem, stay back will ya\u2019? I want to show you something\u201d\n\u201cHere, come take a walk. You did say you enjoyed hikes right?\u201d\n[Moon led Hemlock up a nearby trail. when they reached the top, it was getting late. Moon sat on a ledge and signaled Hemlock to join her. She pointed at the clear night sky.]\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the dark night. The stars and planets just make me feel safe\u2026 I havent been able to cone here for a while, and I wanted to share this spot with someone..\u201d\n[Moon rested her head on Hemlock\u2019s shoulder and watched the night sky. She sighed.]\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make an effort to take care of everyone. Not just the world and the resistance, but for myself too\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThank you Hemlock\u2026 It\u2019s getting late, people might ask where we are. Let\u2019s head back and get some rest.\u201d\n[Moon climbed into her bed and fell asleep, preparing for tomorrow\u2019s tasks]\n[Once she was back at her dorm, Moon got ready for her meeting with the board. She walked into the meeting room fifteen minutes later and sat.]\n\u201cHello, Moon,\u201d Octavian, the head of the board, said. \u201cHave a seat, we have matters to discuss with you.\u201d\n[She kept a calm face, but was anxious on the inside about what the director had to say. She slightly stiffened as all the board members turned to her.]\n[She went to visit her base doctor, Dr. Whiskey, (Dr. Whiskey is a female) to discuss ideas how to improve her health.]\n[Moon walked to her office door and knocked]\n\u201cDr. Whiskey? Are you available ma\u2019am..?\u201d\n[Moon walked inside and took a seat.]\n\u201cSo\u2026 the board talked to me and alot of other people have been saying I need to care for myself some more so\u2026 here I am..\u201d\n[Moon relaxed and sighed]\n\u201cI enjoy what I do here, I dont want to stop because of some careless act I made..\u201d\n[Moon leaned back]\n\u201cI wake up, do a few stretches. Then I go and eat some breakfast\u2026 attend some meetings, talk with Tom and Hemlock\u2026 Then I gotta do paperwork and research\u2026 Now I have to go for a checkup every day, then I go to my room to relax.. Then around Five o\u2019clock I work out for an hour, then I return to my room and shower\u2026 Then I meet with some staff and faculty.. Next, I eat some dinner and I relax for the rest of the day\u2026. It\u2019s different for missions\u2026\n\u201cThats true\u2026 thank you for your time, Dr. Whiskey.\u201d\n[Moon went back to her room and texted a group chat with her, Tom, and Hemlock. She asked if they wanted to plan a trip once they were done giving everyone the cure.]\n> \u201cWe can spend a week in Washington? I heard Cadillac Mountain had a nice view, and it\u2019s on the coast, so we can go to the beach.\u201d\n[Moon put down her phone and took Dr. whiskey\u2019s advice. She laid on her bed and meditated, recalling all the events in her life leading up to this point and reflecting on them.]\n[Having taken some time to meditate, Moon got up and took out her laptop. She began to plan for the week-long trip]\n[She grabbed the anatomy book she had been reading and opened it to her marked page, continuing to explore its contents]\n[Moon took a short stroll around, then she headed to the cafeteria for dinner with Hemlock and Tom]\n[Moon backtracked a bit, retracing her words]\n\"Well, I do have a trip plan already. I'll send it to you guys later after dinner, after I go and get checked-up by the scientists... They just want to check up on me and see how I'm reacting to the cure they gave..\"\n[Moon walked into the science and medical wing and approached Prof. Maximus]\n\"Good evening Max, you wanted to see me for a checkup?\"\n\"Thank you, your division has worked wonders for us. Everyone is grateful for all your work in the resistance.\"\n[Moon sent the plans to Tom and Hemlock, and invited Hemlock to meet at her cliffside spot for sunset if he was free]\n[Later, Moon hiked up the trail and waited for Hemlock before sunset]\n\"It's funny y'know?\" Moon said as she took a seat on the ledge. \"I mean, how we met and our bond now... It reminds me how a sentence can do alot..\"\n////can you write an 800-1000 word essay about Moon's personality, weaknesses, strengths, and experiences? And use quotes from the storyline?\n//Do you want descriptions of all 3 characters?\nHemlock is a man of mystery, with a reputation for being one of the most elusive and dangerous mercenaries in the business. Hemlock is a man with a unique blend of British and Vietnamese heritage. His mixed background has given him a distinctive perspective on life, and he takes pride in his diverse roots. \nHemlock is fluent in both English and Vietnamese, which has proven to be a valuable asset in his professional and personal life.

He believes in the importance of family and community and strives to be a positive influence on those around him. Despite facing challenges and obstacles, Hemlock remains steadfast and resilient, drawing on the strength and resilience of his heritage.\nHemlock is a man of few words, preferring to let his actions speak for him. He is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship, and tactical strategy. He has worked for various clients around the world, completing missions that range from extraction to assassination. Despite his tough exterior, Hemlock has a soft spot for those in need. He has been known to take on missions that involve helping innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of political or military conflict.\nTom is a highly skilled Blackwatch soldier, with a reputation for being one of the best in the business.

However, his skill and reputation speak for themselves. He is a highly sought-after operative, and he has completed countless successful missions for Blackwatch and other high-level clients. With Tom on their side, the Blackwatch team can face any challenge that comes their way.\nMoon is a striking young woman with dark purplish hair that falls in soft waves around her face. Her hair is so dark that it almost appears black in dim lighting, but when the light catches it just right, a deep purple sheen can be seen. Her hair is usually worn long, flowing down to her waist in loose curls.\n\nMoon's eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost navy, with a piercing intensity that can be intimidating to those who meet her gaze.

She has a slim, athletic build, with long legs and toned arms.\n\nDespite her striking appearance, Moon is a humble and down-to-earth person. She is deeply empathetic, with a natural ability to sense and understand the emotions of those around her. This makes her a great listener and a trusted friend to many.\n\nMoon is also a gifted musician, with a hauntingly beautiful voice that she often showcases in the resistance's cafeteria. Her music has a melancholic quality to it, but it is also deeply emotive and moving. \n\nMoon is a free spirit, with a love for travel and exploration. She is always seeking new experiences and adventures, and she has a deep appreciation for the natural world. She can often be found hiking in the mountains or swimming in the ocean, reveling in the beauty of the world around her.\n//alright back to the roleplay!\n\"So... what's the mission? You seems to know more than me,\" Moon turned to Hemlock.\n\"Is it just us? or are we bringing others..? this is pretty sudden...\"\n[Moon got up and she and Hemlock hiked back down and went to bed]\n[Moon finished her jog and prepared for the mission. She got ready and went to meet Hemlock at a meeting room]\n\"Hey Hem, you ready..?\"\n[Moon nodded and smiled at Hemlock, and started to get ready to head back to the resistance base]\n[As they waited, Moon sighed]\n\"You're right... something feels off about this mission. It just.. feels.... easier than expected..\"\n[She marched with Hemlock to the mission's transport. Flashing a smile at him occasionally]\n[Moon took deep breaths to calm her nerves]\n\"We'll see this mission through. I'm confident about it... we've got each other's back...\"\n\"Thanks, Hem... You're an amazing soldier as well... I'm glad we met. Now let's do this..\"\n[Moon packed her gear and got up, beaming a confident smile.]\n\"Take out two guards and grab disguises from them, we'll infiltrate the camp and we'll see what we've gotta do. We do need to take a break every-so-often though, the board had to scold me about that...\"\n[Moon nodded]\n\"Let's go,\" Moon whispered. Hemlock could almost feel her unease, but she kept her guard up high.\n[Moon and Hemlock burst into the tent with their disguises]\n[Moon nodded and heaved a heavy sigh]\n\"That went well, let's call for extraction and get out of here..\"\n[Moon picked up her radio and started to call, but before she could say another word, she and Hemlock got shot with sedatives]\n[Moon forced herself up and stretched to get rid of the cloud in her head. She looked around and tried to figure out where she was.]\n[Moon took a shaky knee by Hemlock and helped him up]\n[Moon took some shaky breaths, her experience at BlackWatch started to catch up with her. Hemlock could feel her unease.]\n\"W-We'll be fine.. j-just wait for an opportunity. We just need to find the right way to get out of here, stay strong...\"\n[Moon nodded, trembling.]\n\"Exactly, that should be a good plan...\"\n[Moon followed Hemlock closely, carefully. Both of them were trying their best to not get caught.]\n\"We need to be careful, yes, but We can't stay hidden forever. They know we're missing, they're searching for us.\"\n[Moon scanned the area, hoping to find a weak point.]\n\"They left a spot open in the northern side, we can get through there...\" Moon looked at Hemlock.\n[Moon bolted away from the camp once she was sure that Hemlock had gotten out. Hemlock was following close behind trying to figure out the reason for such rush. Moon slowed down a few minutes later and slumped against a tree]\n[Moon took some calming breaths]\n\"The cell triggered some... memories...\" She sat down on the ground. \"Back at the BlackWatch camp... Maybe I should talk to someone when I get back.\"\n[Moon sighed] \n\"Extraction is going to take a few minutes to arrive, we can just sit for now...\"\n[She suddenly hugged Hemlock]\n\"Thanks, Hem....\"\n[She slowly got up as the helicopter came overhead]\n[Mon calmed down as the heli returned to base. She fell asleep halfway back]\n[Moon and Hemlock went to their respectful rooms to prepare for the meeting, putting on the dark camo resistance uniforms (Navy Blue and Dark grey for Moon, Black and a mix of Greens for Hemlock). They walked out a few minutes later to head to the meeting.]\n\"Looking fine as always, let's go.\" Moon smiled.\n[Moon and Hemlocked walked around the base for a stroll, after a while, Moon nodded at him]\n\"I'm going to see if Dr. Whiskey knows anyone I can talk to... And maybe go talk to the lab again... I'm still feeling aftereffects from the sedatives...\"\n[Moon went to the lab, and arrived in a few minutes]\n\"Is Prof. Maximus here..?\"\n[She thanked the assistant and walked to the office. She knocked]\n\"I'm concerned about an effect of the virus... maybe it's messing with my head? I'm getting flashbacks that I wasn't having before, and I still feel drugged from sedatives from several hours ago.\" [Moon sat on a nearby chair]\n\"Alright, professor. When is the appointment?\"\n\"It will. Thank you.\"\n\"No, it's alright. Have a good day.\"\n[Moon left and went to Dr. Whiskey's office.]\n\"Hey Dr. Whiskey, got a few minutes..?\"\n\"I need to find someone to talk to about... stuff....\"\n[Moon sat and fidgeted with her hair]\n\u201cWell\u2026 I have flashbacks. And sometimes it messes with me\u2026 I dont want to compromise myself because I was too negligent to seek help in time..\u201d\n[She took a deep breath]\n\u201cThey happen during missions and sometimes if I stay in a room for a bit\u2026 they make me remember BlackWatch\u2026 and what I went through there..\u201d\n\u201cI told Hemlock on the way back here but\u2026 nobody else really..\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s come up a few..\u201d\n\u201cAlright\u2026 The board did say to take care of myself\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you..\u201d\n[Moon shrugged]\n\u201cSure, a professional could help\u2026 Can\u2019t hurt to try\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Dr. Whiskey..\u201d\n///write a 50,000-word research report about Moon and her personality, looks (Navy blue eyes and long wavy dark purple hair), strengths, weaknesses, and development, and use quotes from the roleplay as evidence.

Be sure to include much detail. (Be sure to put quotes inside paragraphs and not just at the end. This includes no bullet point lists, and no using the same quote twice for different sections.) \n[Example of how to structure the body paragraphs: \nTopic sentence, \"quote,\" explanation.]\nA paragraph is 5 sentences.

It's also very old and is only inhabited on one wing of the building. This creates a sense of mystery as the reader does not know what is on the other wing of the manor house and could remind the reader of a haunted house. \n\nPlease give feedback on my answer.\nCan you give me an example of a question from Edexcel on language and structure and provide a text as well\nHeres my answer:\n\n[answer]:\n\nIn the opening of the text, structure is shown from the use of development throughout the text which clearly engages the reader. \n\nPlease give me one piece of feedback, then I would like to try again.\nCould you give me an idea on where to go next?\ncan you give 2 examples of question 1 from the edexcel exam\nhow would you approach the first example you gave?\nPlease limit yourself to 3 sentences.\nNow could you give me a sample answer to this question.\nwhat Assessment objectives will i expect to see in langauge paper 2 , Edexcel\nCan you give me some examples of AO1\nCan you give some examples relating to a specific text"

        "prompt": "could you help me understand this story? what it is trying to say about Morningstar and Morpheus: Lisa had been a dedicated employee of Lux for over a decade, working her way up from a salesperson to the store manager. \n\nShe found her boss, Dr. Morningstar, incredibly fascinating. They were the most beautiful person she had ever known, with an otherworldly quality that was difficult to define, but undeniably captivating. When she started the job, Dr. Morningstar appeared aloof and detached, but as time passed, their relationship became warmer.\n\nLisa was always impressed by Dr. Morningstar's remarkable talent as a piano player, but their partner Morpheus was even more exceptional. When the two of them played a duet in the store, it was nothing short of spectacular.\n\nToday was just another regular workday. Lisa arrived early to prepare the store for opening and found that Dr. Morningstar and their partner were already there. Her boss was playing a solo on the piano while Morpheus watched them closely. Lisa couldn't help but notice the look of pure adoration on Morpheus' face, a small but unmistakable smile tugging at the corners of his lips. \n\nThe music that filled the air was one that had been sung for generations, and it had brought Lisa endless comfort during times of grief and struggle. She quietly sang the lyrics along with the melody, letting the familiar words and tune soothe her soul. As the music reached its peak, she felt the urge to sing out loud, but she didn't want to disturb the moment that felt like an eternity.\n\n\u201cWhen we've been here ten thousand years. \n\nBright, shining as the sun,\n\nWe've no less days to sing God's praise,\n\nThan when we first begun.\u201d\n\nAs Lisa lost herself in the music, she felt her eyes grow moist and tears began to fall. She didn't even realize when the song had come to an end.\n\nAfter she snapped out of her thoughts, Dr. Morningstar was already standing in front of her, their outstretched hand holding a key. \"I've finished the paperwork. The store is now yours. I bid you farewell,\" they said.\n\nLisa felt a jolt of electricity shoot through her veins. She had always dreamed of owning her own store, but she never expected it to happen like this. \n\n\u201cI will take good care of Lux.\u201d She took the key from Dr. Morningstar with a trembling hand. It was a dream that came true. \n\nLisa watched as the couple walked out of the door of the shop, hand in hand. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into a brilliant light unlike anything she had ever seen before. It was as if the light wielded a power that could shatter the boundaries between life and death.\n\nAs the light faded away, Lisa noticed a white feather with a star-like glow lying on the ground. Somehow, long ago, she had known that this day would come. She picked up the weightless material. It felt like the end of an era but also the beginning of a new chapter in her life.\nwhere do you think Dr. Morningstar and Morpheus go?\nthe song in the story is?\ndo you know why Morningstar played that song?\nwho do you think Morningstar is, if they are a legend figure?\nyou guessed Dr. Morningstar is Lucifer. what are the hint, besides the name?\ndo you think the song Morningstar played is a hint?\nwhat you read was the epilogue of the my story-the previous chapter here. could you tell me what it means? After dinner time, the doorbell rang. Lucifer quickly opened the door. As promised, Dream had returned from his trip. After letting Dream in, they leaned in and gave him a passionate kiss.\n\nAs they broke the kiss, Dream spoke up, \"We should talk, Lightbringer.\"\n\n\u201cAbout what, Sweet Morpheus?\u201d Lucifer said with a tired smile, \u201cThe inevitable?\u201d \n\nDream led them out onto the balcony. The cool evening breeze carried the scent of blooming flowers. The sun had just dipped below the horizon, leaving behind a rich tapestry of colors in the western sky. The remaining light gave the sky a warm hue, with streaks of gold, pink, and orange that gradually faded into the deep blues and purples of twilight. The stars were like tiny diamonds scattered across the darkening canvas above. \n\nThe sight was nothing short of magnificent, a breathtaking moment frozen in time.\n\nDream looked tenderly into Lucifer's eyes and spoke softly, \"I believe that your Father could forgive you.\"\n\n\"Morpheus, this is the wildest story I have ever heard,\" Lucifer attempted to conceal their bitterness with a neutral tone but was not successful. \n\nDream walked quietly to the kitchen. He retrieved Lucifer's jar of ghost peppers and passed it to them. \"I found something interesting in the Bible. It says, 'The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him.' This speaks to your situation quite well.\"\n\n\"That promise is for His humans,\" Lucifer felt a sharp pain in their chest. \"I can't help but wonder, how could He go so far as to die for these creatures, to protect them from Hell, from me?\" They clenched their fists and felt a surge of anger mixed with the pain.\n\n\"I do not know,\" Dream\u2019s voice filled with a touch of sadness. He paused for a moment before continuing. \"But perhaps. Perhaps it shows that His love is vast.\u201d\n\n\"Thanks for your efforts to entertain me, Sweet Morpheus,\" they turned away from Dream and walked back into the living room from the balcony. \"But there's no point in wishful thinking.\"\n\nA few moments later, a deep voice sliced through the silence like a knife.\n\n\u201cWell, Lightbringer, what is it that kills hope?\u201d\n\nThe fallen angel stopped in their tracks. They turned sharply back to face Dream, whose eyes were now shining with unshed tears. It was a look so similar to the one they had seen on that fateful day when he rose from the cold floor of Hell's palace.\n\nThey locked eyes with each other, seemingly for an eternity.\n\n \n\nLucifer dreamed.\n\nThey were not fighting Michael, nor walking in the Garden of Eden. This time, it was a beautiful place where they had never been before. The sun shone down on rolling hills covered in a soft blanket of green grass, dotted with vibrant wildflowers. A gentle breeze carried the scent of blooming trees and the sound of a nearby river, its crystal-clear waters glistening in the sunlight. It all looked familiar, but in a way that they could not describe, as if they had glimpsed this place in a distant memory long forgotten.\n\nThen, there appeared a short figure with tanned, sun-kissed skin, their lustrous hair tightly tied back in a sleek braid. Their eyes, though bright and beautiful, carried a sharpness that spoke of deep sadness and weariness, as if they had seen too much of the world's hardships.\n\nEve, the first woman. \n\nEve\u2019s eyes widened, and she took a step back. \n\n\u201cSamael?\" \n\nLucifer's heart skipped a beat. Samael. It was a name that had not been used to address them in eons, a name that brought back memories of a time long forgotten. Memories of a different life, a different purpose, a different identity.\n\n\u201cYes, it is me.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy are you here? The last time we met, you brought me nothing but doom,\" Eve's voice was laced with simmering anger. \u201cWhat do you want to do to me this time?\u201d\n\n\"I mean you no harm,\" Lucifer declared with a measured voice. They did not want to see Eve, but there seemed to be a purpose to this meeting. There was a feeling inside of them, one they were not ready to admit, but one they knew they had to voice.\n\nAnd so they spoke again.\n\n\"The last time I saw you, I did not treat you fairly. There were no amends I could make, but I hope you can find peace.\u201d\n\nWith every word that was spoken, the tension in Eve's features seemed to dissolve little by little. She bit her lip, and a tear rolled down her cheek. \"After all, I was the one who decided to eat that fruit. Now, we shall part ways...\u201d\n\nThen Eve was gone. Lucifer felt she was gone from the realm. Forever.\n\n\"She's gone to a better place.\" A figure dressed in white appeared next to them, in stark contrast to Morpheus, but carrying the same authority. It was Daniel Hall, Morpheus's successor. \"This dream is over. I bid you farewell.\u201d \n\nLucifer woke up with a start, still resting their head on Dream's shoulder. They felt disoriented, yet somehow refreshed.\n\n\"Did you have a good sleep?\" Dream's voice was soft and gentle.\n\n\"Perhaps. I want to take a walk, no...a flight.\"\n\nLucifer\u2019s wings unfurled. A sudden burst of light filled the room with an ethereal glow. For a moment, it seemed as though the wings were not made of feathers, but of tiny, shimmering stars.\nwho arranged Luicfer and Eve's meeting in the dream?\nif it is not Morpheus, who else?\nbefore this chapter, Lucifer's wings were not glowing, it did not have starlight. now after the dream, their wings changed. what does it mean?\nWith every word that was spoken, the tension in Eve's features seemed to dissolve little by little. She bit her lip, and a tear rolled down her cheek.--why Eve's tension was going away? and where did she go after the dream?\n\"After all, I was the one who decided to eat that fruit. Now, we shall part ways...\u201d---what does this say about Eve?"

We need to get you into some clean clothes,\" the mother explained as she put the dirty diaper and wipes in the toilet.\n\nThe mother sat down on the toilet and took care of her own business.

You made a lot of poop!\"\n\n\"Can I flush it, Mama? Can I?\" Emma asked excitedly.\n\n\"Sure, honey. You can flush it,\" the mother said with a smile. Emma proudly pressed the handle, and the toilet water swirled and spun, pulling the dirty diaper and wipes into the drain.\n\nNext, the mother flushed the soiled shirt. \"No, Mama, not my shirt!\" Emma protested as she watched her favorite shirt go into the toilet.\n\n\"I'm sorry, honey, but the diaper mess got all over your shirt. We can't keep it. We need to flush it away so we can finish cleaning up and get you into your fresh outfit,\" the mother explained.\n\nEmma pouted as she watched the water swirl and spin, pulling the shirt into the drain. \"Goodbye, shirt,\" she said sadly.\n\nThe mother then flushed the overalls. \"No, Mama, not my overalls!\" Emma protested as she watched her favorite overalls go into the toilet.\n\n\"I'm sorry, honey, but the diaper mess got all over your overalls too. We can't keep them. We need to flush them away so we can finish cleaning up and get you into your fresh outfit,\" the mother explained.\n\nEmma pouted as she watched the water swirl and spin, pulling the overalls into the drain. The overalls barely fit down the drain, but they eventually disappeared with a final splash. \"Bye bye, overalls. I'll miss you too,\" Emma said sadly.\n\nThe mother put a new diaper on Emma and helped her into a fresh outfit. Emma was excited to see her new yellow sundress with white flowers and matching sandals.\n\nThe mother finished cleaning up the bathroom and was grateful for the extra set of clothes she had packed in the diaper bag. Emma was happy to be feeling fresh and clean again.\n\n\"Phew, that was a close one. Let's not have any more diaper blowouts for a while, okay?\" the mother said, relieved that everything had been successfully flushed away without any problems.\n\n\"Okay, Mama.

These symptoms result from an overgrowth of ectopic endometrial tissue2. Endometriosis is commonly misdiagnosed for several reasons, the most notable being that pelvic pain is a symptom which overlaps with other gynecological diseases, and the lack of knowledge regarding its pathogenesis3.\n\nHowever, research demonstrates that endometriosis is a partly genetically inherited disease (with a heritability of ~50%)4,5 By defining the genetic profile of endometriosis, genetic screening could provide an alternative diagnosis method and eliminate unnecessary diagnostic procedures, which would facilitate patients receiving the treatment they require.\n\nRecently, genome research tools have been developed, such as genome-wide association (GWA) studies and exome sequencing. Through GWA studies, several candidate genes associated with endometriosis risk have been discovered, which will be discussed further on in light of a systematic literature review on endometriosis GWA studies. On the other hand, exome sequencing of endometriosis has been conducted in very few studies; there are no relevant systematic literature reviews published to date. Thus, a case-control study in Greece (Matalliotakis et al, 2017)6 will be discussed to illustrate the importance of investing in exome sequencing.\n\nIn light of this research, this paper proposes a novel combined research method of GWA and exome sequencing studies, addressing the lack of multidisciplinary studies on this topic. This could contribute to identifying the endometriosis genome, which is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.\n\nA systematic review of GWA-studies of endometriosis\nA GWA study takes a large population of patients that share a characteristic (ie, a disease) and a population of controls that do not share this characteristic. Then, the most frequently appearing genetic risk variants in these genomes are highlighted and considered as possible contributing genes to this characteristic\u2014in this case endometriosis risk. These highlighted genes are the candidate genes.\n\nIn 2020, Cardoso et al7 published a systematic literature review on endometriosis. The goal of this systematic review was to describe the candidate genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified thus far, and to discuss the conflicting results of these 15 studies. The results of this review pointed to 11 candidate genes or SNPs that might be associated with an increased endometriosis risk. However, the authors identified a number of confounding factors, the most notable being the overrepresentation of Caucasian patients, and the small sample sizes of many studies. Therefore, the authors emphasize the importance of conducting GWA studies on large populations of differing ethnic backgrounds to accurately identify the risk variants specific to these distinct populations.\n\nExome sequencing of endometriosis: a study in Greece\nSimilar to GWA studies, exome sequencing selects a patient population and a control group. A specific portion of DNA of these populations are sequenced, which contain the loci of the candidate genes found through GWA studies. Then, a correlation between the possible risk variants and the disease is determined. Mutations in protein-coding DNA sequences contribute to increased disease risk. Therefore, exome sequencing does not sequence the entire genome\u2014which includes junk DNA as well\u2014but only the exome. Therefore, exome sequencing is a cost-effective approach to genome research, which is interesting for conducting these studies in larger quantities, globally.\n\nIn a population of 166 Greek women with endometriosis and 150 controls, Matalliotakis et al (2017)6 examined three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine if they were correlated with endometriosis risk. These SNPs were rs7521902, rs10859871, rs11031006 which map to the genetic loci WNT4, VEZT, and FSHB, respectively. These SNPs were selected based on a meta-analysis of GWA studies8. Their findings indicate that the allele variants located on the loci WNT4 and FSHB could be correlated with endometriosis risk. These results are promising and could extend our knowledge of endometriosis genomics. However, they may not be applicable to every population.\n\nThe importance of combining GWAS and exome sequencing, and discussing study parameters\nGWA studies are a fairly novel tool to quickly identify the allele frequency in patients\u2019 genomes to find a relatively plausible set of candidate genes, which subsequently can be examined in exome sequencing studies. However, there are underlying genetic factors that complicate the study of endometriosis genomics. For instance, epistatic reactions, where one gene variant can \u201covershadow\u201d another gene, thereby rendering the causal gene unidentifiable1. This is, as of date, impossible to examine through the software used in GWA studies due to limited computational power. Thus, the use of exome sequencing to fill in these gaps of genetical information will be crucial to unravel the endometriosis genome1.\n\nHowever, exome sequencing remains critically dependent on reliable GWA data. More specifically, small sample size, lack of ethnic diversity, and incomplete patient characteristics are detrimental to the proper interpretation of a GWA study1. In the study by Matalliotakis et al (2017)6, candidate genes association rates differed according to clinical disease stage. Thus, Lalami et al1 insist that classifying patients according to their clinical characteristics is a key component to improving the detection of relevant candidate genes.\n\nThe inheritable nature of endometriosis has been well established for decades. The study of genome-wide association has improved our understanding of the genetic basis of this disease. However, endometriosis is heterogeneous and complex; its genomics have yet to be extensively researched to the point where these findings can be utilized in clinical practice. The limited amount of research published to date is a testament to this. Clearly, additional exome sequencing studies are required.\n\nOverall, researchers agree on the need to conduct GWA studies in large, ethnically diverse, and clinically well characterized patient populations.. This is expected to yield a selection of reliable candidate genes which in turn may be investigated thoroughly in smaller (familial) populations through exome sequencing. Narrowing down this selection will ensure that exome sequencing can be utilized cost-effectively, therefore more studies may be conducted. Consequently, our knowledge of its pathogenesis can be broadened. This would lead to opportunities in developing medicine for treatment and genetic screenings for diagnoses. As a result, women with endometriosis would benefit from this advancement in women\u2019s medical health.\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n1. Lalami I, Abo C, Borghese B, Chapron C, Vaiman D.

Based on a selected body of literature reviews and historical primary texts,plus a number of field works and comparative analysis,this paper shows that Buddhist teachings are helpful during periods of suffering and can facilitate the patients and their family members peacefully accept the death. It also puts forward how people face death reality and the way they use to comfort themselves pacifically in the last period of their life could indicate different qualities of death.The purpose and the value of this thesis aims at attempting to integrate Buddhist philosophy combining with medical hospice care among incurable cancer patients and family members in China mainland to diminish their excruciation in dealing with facing death . \n\nKey words: Buddhism,Buddhist teachings (philosophy),Hospice care, Peaceful Death. \n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to the the study,hospice care is defined as predominantly community based program that provides interprofessional multidimensional care for patients with terminal illness(i.e,expected survival<6months) and their families,working in conjunction with volunteers to provide services ranging from symptom management to bereavement care.(Hui et al. 2013).And Buddhist teachings have the lasting correlation to relate death to life,plus, some of the practices like mindfulness, meditation are widely popularized among people in the world to help release the pressure and pain in daily life and has become an important element of psychotherapeutic treatment,the application to hospice care involving Buddhist philosophy among cancer patient and their family might also been taken into consideration.Moreover,a study shows that Japan-Korea-Taiwan research network has been set up as a collaboration which requires for the East-Asian collaborative cross-cultural study to elucidate the dying process (EASED) cohort. (Cheng et al, 2016). According to this research, the Hospice and Palliative Care Unit of the National Taiwan University Hospital was looking into applying Buddha dharma in terminal care. And, In 2004, the Japan Association for Buddhist Nursing and Vihara Studies was initiated by the former president of the Buddhist University Yukimasa Mizutani and Professor Hitoshi Tamiya, who advocated for Buddhist hospice care.They did so in order to organize the Buddhist community to conduct research on Buddhist nursing and end-of-life care.(\u5f20\u6587\u826fZhang Wenliang,2018). In addition to Taiwan and Japan,in South Korea , Buddhist hospice care was introduced by Venerable Haedo, who studied social welfare and the vihara movement in Japan. (Tedesco, 1998). According to Tedesco,earlier in 1994, the Buddhist Volunteer Service Association trained volunteers in South Korea to help the chronically ill and dying (Tedesco 1998).\nThough Buddhism consequently evolved into various ways,Buddhist healing has since its transmission remained a considerable correlation with the health care domain in the region.(Salguero et al,2020) However,it is notable that Buddhism was introduced to China in the late Han Dynasty(206BCE-220CE), and many Buddhist texts concentrate on the illness as a location to consummate Buddhist meditation practices(Capitanio,J.2013),unlike Japan-Korea-Taiwan,there still lacks end of life care integration with Buddhist teachings in China mainland among the populace.Therefore,there remains a research gap about how to integrate a Buddhist hospice palliative care in mainland China among the terminally ill patients and their families. But, Is it beneficial to apply Buddhist mindfulness to hospice palliative care among cancer patients and their families in mainland China?Although many people have a general idea of what Buddhist teachings entail,they do not apply it correctly nor integrate it fully into their daily life. In the light of this,a solution to fill this research gap will be explored as there are numbers of people who rely on Buddhist philosophy to free themselves from sufferings both spiritually and physically in China mainland. This paper means to answer this question. \nMethods & Expected Results \nPrimary text analysis and literature reviews as well as case studies are used to answer main research question Is it beneficial to apply Buddhist teachings to hospice care among cancer patients and their families in mainland China? The historical evidences and their influences on the society at that time are collected by using primary text analysis.And then,via studying different successful development cases mainly in Japan and Taiwan as well as analyzing number of literature correlations,the reasons and gap why there is little cases happened in contemporary mainland China will be gradually presented.Thirdly, some online field work will be conducted to settle the sub-research questions like how the people view the Buddhist philosophy in their daily life in mainland China as well as examine if the people (patients and their family )actively adopt Buddhist teachings and practices regard with life and death to help them reduce the mental suffering in the terminally ill condition.At last, all the data will be collected and sorted out via content analyzing and coding to highlight the factors that limit the development of involving Buddhist philosophy among cancer patient and their family as well as noting the benefits for their status and changes. \nAs above mentioned,the research will start with analyzing the historical text by using narratives analysis and discourse analysis mainly in some Buddhist scriptures which can directly present the traces of history,like \u6742\u963f\u542b \u5377\u4e94\u7b2c103\u7ecf\uff0c\u537737\u7b2c1023\u7ecf\uff0c\u7b2c1024\u7ecf\uff0c\u7b2c1025\u7ecf\uff0c\u537741\uff0c\u7b2c1122\u7ecf\u3002\u589e\u4e00\u963f\u542b\u7ecf\uff0c\u537748. \u56db\u5206\u5f8b\u884c\u4e8b\u6284 \uff0c\u5927\u5510\u897f\u57df\u8bb0\uff0c\u534e\u4e25\u7ecfetc.And then,by comparing the literature reviews Advances of hospice palliative care in Taiwan (Cheng et al. 2016), Factors related to spiritual well-being in the last days of life in three East Asian countries: An international multicenter prospective cohort study, Palliative Medicine(Hiratsuka et.al,2021), A cross-cultural comparison of hospice development in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan(Glass,et.al) etc to identify the development of the Buddhist Dharma among cancer patient and their family in Japan and Taiwan.This step is suitable for analyzing the similarities and possible gaps. The online field is conducted through taking field notes from the patients blog&mini log and their family members\u2019 dairy blog in the online forum to help find the effective elements to the development of hospice palliative care involving Buddhist thoughts among cancer patient and their family in mainland China.As in this way can help to perceive more authentic emotion with the target group.Because this kind of resources are relatively limited,therefore,all the posts that can be found will be recorded. In terms of the data selection,some true factors that rightly exert the influence on the application to the Buddhism among cancer patient and their family in mainland China in hospice care are expected.They could be from every aspects of the society,namely patients and their family members,medical staff and hospital management including the Buddhist religion group.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion\n\n Because of the shortage of the contemporary English academia resources among this topic in mainland China, the preliminary resources from Buddhist sutra and the secondary English resources tend to more precious,which brings the novelty into this research.Further more,what are the differences between the hospice care with and without Buddhism intervention while facing the death ? According to Harding,theological religiosity was the only one to have a significant effect on death acceptance and death anxiety (Harding,el.al,2005),it delivers the information that this research paper is on the right way that deserves to explore further.As the purpose and the value of this paper aims at attempting to integrate Buddhism teachings with medical hospice care among cancer patients and family members in China mainland, mastering interdisciplinary knowledge regarding many of the aspects become essentially important ,for instance,to disclose the historical evidence of Buddhism hospice care towards terminally ill patients and their families could give an enlightenment and a guidance to contemporary hospice care system in a more spiritual-care orientation,and to find the research answers by comparing the successful development cases in Japan and Taiwan in converse could affect the humanitarian progress in Chinese hospice care system.Though,the study has the limitation of taking face to face interview and getting more vivid reactions and attitudes from the target patients and their families,plus,during the covid time,it is uneasy to have access to go back to mainland China,the online field work makes sense as more exclusive expression of the authentic emotional thoughts which might not be displayed in front of the public from target patients can be collected.Most importantly,the study could in favor of diminishing people\u2019s excruciation in dealing with facing death ,after all ,this is the destination which everyone will set foot on .\nReferences :\n\nCapitanio, J.

Store that list in a variable called [selinasIdioms] and write out that list without any other explanation.\nGreat list. Now act as a professor teaching english to international college students. Your students are in a business and entrepreneurship course where your goal is to educate them to the vocabulary in common english business idioms. Please generate a multiple choice fill in the blank test using the idioms generated in [selinasIdioms] as questions with one word removed from each. Then provide four answers to fill in the blank with one answer identified as the correct answer and three incorrect using similar vocabulary or commonly interchanged words. Generate the test for the first 10 items in [selinasIdioms] with no additional explanation.\nThanks, now continue generating the test from the last prompt for the last 10 items in [selinasIdioms] with no additional explanation.\nWell done! Now continuing to act as the college professor, write a brief paragraph introduce the test you created to the students taking it and a second paragraph about why this knowledge will be valuable for their future as international students in the business landscape. Please utilize a tone representing someone who is stern but fair who care's about the future of the students but also wants to connect and be relatable to the students.\nWonderful the test proctor Selina will be very pleased. Now that you've completed her work and she is free this weekend, write her a paragraph about how I'm so thoughtful doing this and with her free time she should grab cocktail with me this weekend.\nWhoa whoa whoa, she's the one the owes me now, but you almost got it.

How many does she have left?\", you can put \"CALC( (4530-2) \\* (1 - 34/100))\" in your answer and the calculator will substitute this formula with the result of the calculation. Ok? Any question?\nSally has 50 apples, half of them are bad. She eats one and of the reminder, she keeps 1/3 and splits the rest between frank and mary. Mary eats 5. How many does Mary have keft?\nSally has 50 apples, half of them are bad. She eats one and of the remainder, she keeps 1/3 and splits the rest between frank and mary. Mary eats 5.

In this cross-sectional study, the authors aimed to explore correlates of stigma towards mental health in a Lebanese private university and its associated tertiary medical center.\nMethods\nThe authors surveyed students, staff, and faculty at the American University of Beirut and its associated medical center. They assessed stigmatizing behaviors via the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS), perceived stigma via the Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDDS), and attitudes towards collaborating with mental health professionals via the Doctors\u2019 Attitudes toward Collaborative Care for Mental Health (DACC-MH).\nResults\nA total of 270 participants (response rate of 18%) provided their responses. The mean scores on the RIBS and PDDS were 15.26 \u00b1 4.75 and 32.25 \u00b1 2.70, respectively. Participants who had higher scores on RIBS were more likely to be younger than 25 years of age (OR=1.869; p=0.026), to have a history of mental illness (OR=2.657; p=0.003), and to interact with individuals with a psychiatric disorder (OR=2.287; p=0.028).\nConclusions\nResults show a mixed pattern of stigmatizing behaviors and perceptions towards mental illness. This highlights the need for mental health awareness campaigns and interventions in the country.\n\u7ffb\u8b6f\nStigma is a \u201cdeeply discrediting\u201d attribute that reduces one \u201cfrom a whole and usual person to a tainted discounted one\u201d [1]. It is a dangerous, multifaceted construct related to a set of negative beliefs that a society has towards a particular topic. It usually leads to negative consequences, including separation, loss of status, and discrimination [2].\nIndividuals with mental illness may be affected by stigma. They typically experience shame and marginalization secondary to their diagnosis and often describe the repercussions of mental health stigma as worse than those of the illness itself [3]. The stigma they endure is shown to impact their social lives, relationships, professional careers, and psychological wellbeing [3].\nStigma towards mental illness represents a worldwide public health crisis, with cultural differences contributing to global variations in the profile of stigma [4]. In the Arab world, mental illness has been reported as \u201cshameful\u201d and an \u201cembarrassment\u201d [5]. This typically translates into individuals being reluctant to seek professional care [6]. In Lebanon, the notion of mental illness has been conventionally appended to \u201cinsanity\u201d or \u201cmajnoun\u201d in Arabic [7]. Stigma has also been empowered by a lack of awareness and knowledge, and fueled by subcultural beliefs associating mental illness with paranormal entities such as Jinn and the Evil Eye [6]. These views have been shown to be endorsed by the general community, religious figures, and university students [8,9,10].\nTo our knowledge, no previous study assessed the attitudes of medical or academic personnel towards mental illness in Lebanon. Also, no study compared attitudes between medical students, nurses, and doctors in this setting. We therefore aimed to explore stigma towards mental health in a Lebanese private university and its associated tertiary medical center.\nStudy Design and Sample\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted between February and March 2020. A total of 1,500 individuals from the American University of Beirut were invited to participate in the study. Faculty, staff, and students (undergraduate, graduate, or medical students) at the academic setting as well as faculty and staff (including medical doctors, residents, nurses, psychologists, pharmacists, nutritionists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, case managers, and social workers among others) at the hospital were included in the study. We excluded university alumni from the study.\n\u8acb\u7528\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\u7ffb\u8b6f\nSample Size Calculation\nIn a recently published study, Abi Doumit et al. found that 67.8% of Lebanese have a high score of public stigma towards mental illness [10]. Assuming a type I error of 5%, a significance level at p<0.05, and an absolute error or precision of 5%, the minimum sample size required to replicate this analysis was 171 participants per group (5 groups being non-medical students, medical students, nurses, staff at the academic setting, and residents and faculty members at the hospital). Considering a 50% response rate, a sample size of 300 participants per group (1,500 in total) was required. Accordingly, 1,500 personnel at the American University of Beirut community received the electronic questionnaire via their e-mails.\n\nBetween February and March 2020, we invited participants to fill an online self-administered questionnaire via LimeSurvey, an online survey application. We informed participants about the study, its purpose, and inclusion criteria. Those willing to participate were required to read and accept an online consent form. We sent three reminders at one-week intervals to maximize the efficiency of our recruitment. A total of 328 individuals participated in the study. We included 270 participants with complete responses in the final data analysis achieving, therefore, a response rate of 18%.\nEthical Approval\nThe study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of the American University of Beirut (ID SBS-2019-0485). For privacy and confidentiality, the researchers were blinded to the list of emails of participants and all data were completely de-identified.\nQuestionnaire\nThe questionnaire was in English and included 40 questions, divided into four sections: Sociodemographic and personal data, Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS), Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDDS), and Doctors\u2019 Attitudes toward Collaborative Care for Mental Health (DACC-MH).\nIn addition to providing basic sociodemographic information, participants were asked to indicate their current status/role at the American University of Beirut. Moreover, they were asked to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to prompts about their mental health status: \u201chave you ever suffered from a mental illness?\u201d, \u201chave you ever been in contact with a mental health professional?\u201d, \u201chave you ever taken a prescribed psychotropic medication?\u201d, and \u201cdo you have a family member with a mental illness?\u201d Lastly, they were asked to specify if they were \u201ccomfortable\u201d or \u201cuncomfortable\u201d about disclosing their mental health problems to family/friends and coworkers/colleagues. The option of answering \u201cprefer not to disclose\u201d was possible for all questions in this part.\nThe RIBS is an eight-item scale that measures mental health stigma\u2013related behavior. The original version is psychometrically robust with strong internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.85) and test-retest reliability (r\u2009=\u20090.75). It includes two sections of four items each. The first group calculates the prevalence of behaviors reported in the past or present experiences regarding the following areas: live with, work with, live nearby, or have a relationship with a person with a mental health problem. Each item is coded as \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cdo not know.\u201d The second group of items focuses on future intentions to establish contact with people with a mental health problem in the same areas as described above. Each item is coded on an ordinal scale (1 = disagree strongly to 5 = agree strongly). \u201cDo not know\u201d is coded as neutral. Higher scores correspond to a greater willingness to interact with people with mental illness [11]. In our study, we calculated the average score for each participant. We then created a dichotomous variable to categorize respondents according to their behaviors and attitudes towards individuals with mental illness. A respondent was classified in the Low (or negative) category if they had an average score of 1 to 3, indicating that the respondent mostly endorsed mental health stigma\u2013related behaviors. Alternatively, a respondent was classified in the High (or positive) category if they averaged a score of 3.1 to 5, indicating that, overall, the respondent did not endorse mental health stigma\u2013related behaviors.\nThe PDDS is a twelve-item scale that measures the extent to which a person believes that most people will devalue or discriminate against someone with a mental illness. Each item is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), yielding a total score ranging from 12 to 48. Higher scores indicate greater perceived public stigma and discrimination related to mental illness. The prevalence of high perceived stigma is defined as an item mean score of 2.5 or higher on the mean aggregated scale score (this criterion represents the \u201cmidpoint\u201d on the 1\u20134 item scale). Participants scoring greater than or equal to the mean score of 2.5 are considered to have \u201chigh perceived stigma\u201d and those scoring below 2.5 are considered to have \u201clow perceived stigma\u201d [12].\nThe DACC-MH is an eight-item scale that measures the readiness of doctors to engage in collaborative mental health care. It assesses two core components of collaborative mental health care programs: physicians\u2019 attitudes towards managing mental health problems and towards consulting with psychiatrists. Each item is coded as \u201cagree\u201d or \u201cdisagree,\u201d which are considered as positive and negative responses, respectively. However, for the fourth and eighth items, \u201cdisagree\u201d is considered a positive response. The score for each participant is generated by counting the positive responses. Therefore, the minimal and maximal scores range between zero and eight, meaning the most negative and the most positive attitudes, respectively [13]. Only healthcare professionals at the hospital were allowed to fill out the DACC-MH.\n\u8acb\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\n\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\nThe DACC-MH is an eight-item scale that measures the readiness of doctors to engage in collaborative mental health care.

We assessed the associations between the outcomes (RIBS and PDDS) and specific sociodemographic and personal data using the Pearson chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. We excluded entries that had \u201cprefer not to disclose\u201d as an answer for the sociodemographic data or \u201cnon-binary\u201d for the gender question from the bivariate analysis. We dichotomized participants\u2019 role by institutional affiliation (university or hospital) or status at the hospital (medical students versus nurses, residents, and attendings). We also grouped participants under \u201csought health\u201d if they answered yes to at least one of the following: \u201chave you ever been in contact with a mental health professional?\u201d or \u201chave you ever taken a prescribed psychotropic medication?\u201d In addition, we considered as having \u201csocial interaction\u201d with an individual with mental illness if they answered yes to at least one of the following: \u201care you currently living/working with or have you ever lived/worked with someone with a mental health problem?\u201d or \u201cdo you currently have or have you ever had a neighbor/close friend with a mental health problem?\u201d Finally, we carried out a multivariate stepwise logistic regression to identify the predictors of RIBS. We also did another logistic regression analysis restricted to the hospital setting to shed light on the difference between medical students and other hospital professionals. We presented the results as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a p-value of less than 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. We employed IBM SPSS statistical software for Windows version 22 for the analysis [14].\n\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\nResults\nSociodemographic Characteristics of Participants\nA total of 270 participants provided complete responses to the questionnaire. Almost half (51.5%) were young adults aged between 18 and 25 years. Most participants were women (62.2%) and carried the Lebanese nationality (87.0%). Approximately half of the sample consisted of students from non-medical (17.4%) and medical (39.3%) backgrounds. One-third of participants (33.0%) reported having suffered from a mental illness at a point in their lifetime; only half of them (50.7%) ever contacted a mental health professional and 21.1% of them took prescribed psychotropic medications. Almost half of the sample (42.2%) reported having a family member with a mental illness.\n\nThe mean scores on the RIBS and PDDS were 15.26 \u00b1 4.75 and 32.25 \u00b1 2.70, respectively. Almost two-thirds of participants (59.3%) had high scores on the RIBS and were categorized as having positive views of individuals with mental illness. Close to 90% of participants were found to have high perceived stigma as per the PDDS.\n\nMore information about the sociodemographic characteristics of participants, including their interactions with individuals who have a mental health problem, is provided in Table 1.\n\u8acb\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\nBivariate Analyses of Correlates of High Scores on the RIBS and PDDS\nTable 2 shows the bivariate analyses of correlates of high scores on the RIBS and PDDS. Participants with positive views and attitudes, as detected by the RIBS, were more likely to be medical students than nurses or medical doctors (p=0.001). Moreover, they were more likely to have previously sought help from a mental health professional (p=0.004), to have had a history of mental health issues (p=0.000), and to have had previous interactions with people with mental health problems (p=0.000)\nLooking into public stigma and discrimination related to mental illness as per the PDDS, we found only one significant correlate: participants without a family history of mental health problems had significantly higher perceived stigma than those with a positive family history (p=0.025).\n\nLogistic Regression Analysis of Predictors of High Scores on the RIBS\nWe conducted a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of positive attitudes towards individuals with mental illness in the total sample. The overall model was statistically significant (p=0.002). Participants who had a high score on RIBS were more likely to be younger than 25 years of age (OR=1.869; CI [1.078\u20133.240]; p=0.026), to have a history of mental illness (OR=2.657; CI [1.402\u20135.036]; p=0.003), and to interact with individuals with a psychiatric disorder (OR=2.287; CI [1.092\u20134.789]; p=0.028). Gender and seeking mental health professionals did not achieve significance in the model. Alternatively, our logistic analysis specific to respondents from the hospital yielded a model that was not statistically significant (p=0.644).\n\nReadiness of Doctors to Engage in Collaborative Mental Health Care\nThe majority of respondents who participated in this subsection survey had a positive attitude towards collaborating with the mental health team, as detailed in Table 3.\n\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\nDiscussion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses stigmatizing behaviors and perceived stigma towards mental illness in an academic and hospital setting in Lebanon. Our results show that a high proportion of participants displayed mental health stigma\u2013related behaviors and a striking majority of them had a high level of perceived stigma.\nThese results parallel those of a recent national study showing high prevalence of stigmatizing behaviors and attitudes towards mental illness in a sample of Lebanese citizens [10]. Similar findings were noted in specific local subgroups of students [8] and religious figures [9]. In general, stigmatizing attitudes have been noted in the Arab world and were found to be associated with a limited understanding of the nature of mental illness [15]. In a recent systematic review, a majority of the 33 included articles reported Arab populations as having a negative portrayal of mental illness and endorsing stigmatizing beliefs about the origins and causes of mental illness. Those beliefs were heavily influenced by religious teachings, cultural stereotypes, and family traditions [5].\nWhen further looking into the results, medical students at the American University of Beirut were found to have fewer stigmatizing behaviors than doctors and nurses. This has been previously reported in the literature. A study in The Czech Republic showed that teachers had a greater prevalence of stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors towards psychiatric disorders than medical students [16]. Research has shown that the updated medical curricula and psychiatric clerkships have helped decrease stigma towards mental illness [17]. These results are, however, not always replicated [18]. Such inconsistent findings might be associated with certain pedagogical factors that affect one\u2019s learning experiences [19]. Additionally, recent studies assessing university students in Lebanon [8] and other Arab countries [20] showed high stigmatizing behaviors and misconceptions about mental illness, leading to reluctance in seeking professional help.\n\nAlternatively, the high level of perceived stigma among participating medical professionals is similar to that described in the Arab healthcare setting [21]. Generally speaking, when dealing with mental illness, most Arab families prefer to consult with a family physician. However, several barriers for optimal delivery of mental health services at the primary care level were described. These include the overwhelmingly negative attitudes of Arab physicians towards individuals with mental illness and the consideration of their care as too specialized and challenging [21]. If such discrimination is experienced at the very first help-seeking step, therefore, chances for future mental health referral and treatment might be hindered. Conversely, if stigma in the primary care setting is less prevalent, help-seeking, referral, treatment, and recovery can substantially increase [21]. In our sample of medical professionals, surprisingly, despite the high levels of perceived stigma, a high readiness to collaborate with mental health services was noted. These findings are similar to another regional study employing the DACC-MH, also showing that physicians maintained positive attitudes towards requesting psychiatric consultations [22]. Our results are possibly a reflection of the high level of mental health education provided at our academic center, along with the typically implemented interdisciplinary approach for patients\u2019 care that involves both a psychiatrist and a psychologist.\n\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\nWhen further looking into the results, medical students at the American University of Beirut were found to have fewer stigmatizing behaviors than doctors and nurses. This has been previously reported in the literature. A study in The Czech Republic showed that teachers had a greater prevalence of stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors towards psychiatric disorders than medical students [16]. Research has shown that the updated medical curricula and psychiatric clerkships have helped decrease stigma towards mental illness [17]. These results are, however, not always replicated [18]. Such inconsistent findings might be associated with certain pedagogical factors that affect one\u2019s learning experiences [19]. Additionally, recent studies assessing university students in Lebanon [8] and other Arab countries [20] showed high stigmatizing behaviors and misconceptions about mental illness, leading to reluctance in seeking professional help.\nAlternatively, the high level of perceived stigma among participating medical professionals is similar to that described in the Arab healthcare setting [21]. Generally speaking, when dealing with mental illness, most Arab families prefer to consult with a family physician. However, several barriers for optimal delivery of mental health services at the primary care level were described. These include the overwhelmingly negative attitudes of Arab physicians towards individuals with mental illness and the consideration of their care as too specialized and challenging [21]. If such discrimination is experienced at the very first help-seeking step, therefore, chances for future mental health referral and treatment might be hindered. Conversely, if stigma in the primary care setting is less prevalent, help-seeking, referral, treatment, and recovery can substantially increase [21]. In our sample of medical professionals, surprisingly, despite the high levels of perceived stigma, a high readiness to collaborate with mental health services was noted. These findings are similar to another regional study employing the DACC-MH, also showing that physicians maintained positive attitudes towards requesting psychiatric consultations [22].

This comes in agreement with an analysis from 14 European countries showing that those with mental illness living in a setting with less stigmatizing attitudes, higher rates of treatment utilization, and better-perceived access to information had lower rates of self-stigma and perceived discrimination [23].\nAnother important finding is the high level of perceived stigma among participants. Perceived stigma refers to one\u2019s belief that others perceive an individual as socially unacceptable [24]. This finding reflects societal views of mental health stigma, as questions are addressed following the phrasing \u201cmost people would.\u201d In other words, despite the majority of participants having low stigmatizing behaviors, most found that mental health is negatively perceived in Lebanon.\n\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\nMoreover, results revealed that individuals with a family history of mental illness had less perceived stigma as opposed to their counterparts. In fact, some studies have shown that stigma towards mental illness is lower among people who were familiar with it [25, 26]. However, despite this significant difference in our results, the level of perceived stigma was overall elevated in both groups, regardless of family history. A diagnosis of mental illness carries a stigma that affects family members worldwide [27], particularly in the Arab region where having a psychiatric diagnosis remains a cultural taboo and increases the risk of social rejection. Along the same lines, a multi-site study found a greater occurrence of shame and family embarrassment when a close relative is affected by mental illness [28]. Families are often blamed for their relatives\u2019 illness and criticized for housing potentially dangerous relatives [26]. This concept translates into \u201cstigma-by-association\u201d which affects everyone surrounding the individual with mental illness [1]. \u201cStigma-by-association\u201d represents fear, loss, embarrassment, disgrace, isolation, anger, inability to cope, and eventually helplessness [29]. Unfortunately, strategies that some families employ to cope with this burden, such as \u201cconcealing\u201d or \u201csecrecy,\u201d can often reinforce stigma [30].\nThe impact of stigma on affected individuals includes not only low self-esteem and social isolation but also a more complicated illness trajectory and, eventually, poor quality of life [31]. This heightened stigma comes on top of a burdened mental health system in the Arab world [32]. Lebanon has one of the highest provisions of psychiatric services in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, with a median of 3 mental health professionals per 100,000 population [33]. Yet, this remains insufficient due to the limited facilities and an overall shortage of associated workforce in the country [33]. Additionally, the Lebanese health system still lacks a mental health law and a national mental health policy [32]. And despite the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders within the Lebanese population, mental illness remains considerably stigmatized [34].\nTherefore, it becomes imperative to establish large-scale and targeted strategies that help decrease stigma towards mental illness. One proven effective approach is mental health education for both medical professionals and students. At this level, mental health literacy campaigns, which include whole-of-community campaigns, information websites, Mental Health First Aid training, and other interventions in educational settings [35], have been pivotal; they improve knowledge, attitudes, and help-seeking behaviors [36]. Getting an early start and educating the youth using school-based curricula should be considered, as youth are more likely to seek treatment when assigned specific mental health courses [37]. Therefore, appropriate training modules and effective learning curricula that foster a comfortable anti-stigma environment should be provided for both medical and non-medical students. A more general avenue worth exploring is that of media outlets which may, at times, increase stigma by reinforcing common stereotypes [38]. As such, targeted media interventions, mass awareness campaigns, and social media can reduce stigmatizing attitudes [39], particularly when involving medical professionals. Finally, interactive interventions with individuals with mental illness can help dispel myths about psychiatric disorders [40].\n\u5c07\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5\u82f1\u6587\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\n\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\nOur study has several limitations. First, it has a cross-sectional design and a small sample size. Further, we were not able to reach our target sample size in each subgroup, limiting the scope of the subgroup statistical analyses. Participants were recruited from one academic institution and its affiliated hospital and about 70% of the sample comprised medical personnel only. Also, individuals at the institution typically diverge from the general Lebanese population, particularly in terms of education level and socioeconomic status further restricting the generalizability of our results to the Lebanese community. As the study is based on self-reports, response bias cannot be excluded. Besides, our scales have not been linguistically nor culturally validated in Lebanon; we only provided the English version of the scales to the participants. This might limit the validity of our results; however, students, faculty, and staff in the American University of Beirut are required to be proficient in the English language. It is also worthy to note that the study was done before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Beirut Blast of August 04, 2020. After these events, Lebanon has witnessed a surge of mental health campaigns across various different media outlets, organized by the government, non-governmental organizations, and private institutions. Future studies should assess if these activities have helped increase awareness towards mental illness and reduced stigma among the population.\n\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6210\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\nOur study shows a mixed pattern of stigmatizing behaviors and perceptions towards mental illness at a Lebanese academic institution and hospital. Our results are in accordance with national and regional findings. This highlights the need to promote mental health awareness in Lebanon. One such strategy might be to incorporate mental health education in all school curricula."

She is nearing the end of a battle from Parkinson's disease and has been losing her mental and physical facilities over the last few years. Her husband has his own kids, and has been gifting them large sums of money all-the-while her kids have not seen any money. I'm concerned her money is being unknowingly distributed in an unfair manner to her husbands kids. The primary concern is her will was changed within the last year, likely to favor her husbands children and at the cost of her own children, and it's likely she signed the new will without her full mental capacity. What legal recourse do my parents have available, if any to promote a more even distribution of her wealth?\nWhat type of evidence would be required? Can you think of any examples?\nAll parties reside in Illinois, is there anything pertaining to Illinois law that could help our case? Or make it more challenging?\nDo you have any statistics on how often wills are challenged? And how often a will is deemed invalid?"

        "prompt": "Are you familiar with Roact for Roblox?\nAlright, so I'm trying to learn the Roact library right now. I'm facing an issue, though. After using the \"Context\" features of Roact, I am not able to get both of the children in my interface to show up under ScreenGui. In this case, Button2 should show up as a child, but it isn't. I think the SubTheme context may be interfering with this, but I'm not sure how to fix it. Here's a relevant snippet of my code from the GUI handler. Let me know if I need to provide the underlying code of the components that I've created:\n\nlocal Button = require(PlayerScripts:WaitForChild(\"GuiComponents\")[\"Button\"])\nlocal SubTheme = require(PlayerScripts.GuiComponents.SubTheme)\n\nlocal interface = Roact.createElement(\"ScreenGui\", {}, {\n Button1 = Roact.createElement(Button, {\n Position = UDim2.new(0,0,0,0);\n });\n SubTheme = Roact.createElement(SubTheme, {}, {\n Button2 = Roact.createElement(Button, {\n Position = UDim2.new(0,0,0,50);\n });\n })\n})\n\nRoact.mount(interface, PlayerGui)\nYour suggestion makes sense and should work, and it's probably what I would do in a standard situation. However, I watched a tutorial on YouTube and the guy shows his code working as intended without using fragments. In fact, the way I implemented the stuff is largely the same as he did. Here's the video link (in case that helps at all): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA5iDkhKqLw. What's the deal?\nThank you! The issue was an error in how I included self.props[Roact.Children], as you suggested. I had it in the code, however a misplaced curly brace caused the Roact.Children table to be included as a prop, not as a child of the element."

        "prompt": "Hey, I need some help with Linux. There's a line in /var/log/syslog that says the following:\n\nMar 1 07:17:29 Lunux kernel: [12639.283291] audit: type=1400 audit(1677673049.863:306817): apparmor=\"DENIED\" operation=\"ptrace\" class=\"ptrace\" profile=\"snap.discord.discord\" pid=3236 comm=\"Utils\" requested\\_mask=\"read\" denied\\_mask=\"read\" peer=\"unconfined\"\n\nI do not understand this line. Are you able to explain to me what it's saying?\nI see, thank you. So does that mean that \"snap.discord.discord\" keeps trying to do something that AppArmor keeps denying?\nWell, I have 300GB of a logfile because of it repeatedly doing that. Do you have any idea on how to fix this?\nDoes Flatpak use AppArmor?\nHmm. What if I install Discord as a normal program? Would that help against the AppArmor issue?\nGood thinking. Thank you for this information. I'm a Linux newbie so I'm trying to learn, but it's a whole different ballpark from Windows.\n\nIs it possible to know what exactly this log line says what Discord is trying to do? From what you've given me, it seems that Discord is trying to do some sort of ptrace operation called \"read\", but it's denied. \n\nI have no idea how to mess with AppArmor. What would be relevant to what I'm looking for, regarding AppArmor? I'm using Kubuntu, if that helps.\nIs there a way to change the relevant profiles without installing a new application? Is there a settings file somewhere for AppArmor?\nUnder \"/etc/apparmor.d\", there seems to be no existing \"snap.discord.dsicord\" file. Attempting to open the command you gave me, gives me back that Nano is making a new file.\nWait, if Apparmor wasn't enabled for the Discord snap package, why would it be blocking the read?\nWell, we know that AppArmor is definitely blocking Discord. And I did check with your commands that it's on, and it's definitely installed and running/enforcing stuff on my program. \n\nAre there multiple places that AppArmor would have settings files on? Perhaps a place other than /etc/apparmor.d?\nI ran \"sudo snap debug sandbox-features discord\" and it gave me an error, saying \"too many arguments for command\".\nStill says the same thing. Are you certain that \"sandbox-features\" is the correct part in the command?\nQuick question before I run the code, what does \"grep\" do?\nI see. Here is the output of the command you gave me:\n\n/snap/discord/150/usr/share/discord/Discord (30796) snap.discord.discord\n /snap/discord/150/usr/share/discord/Discord (30878) snap.discord.discord\n /snap/discord/150/usr/share/discord/Discord (30879) snap.discord.discord\n /snap/discord/150/usr/share/discord/Discord (30913) snap.discord.discord\n /snap/discord/150/usr/share/discord/Discord (30924) snap.discord.discord\n /snap/discord/150/usr/share/discord/Discord (30972) snap.discord.discord\n /snap/discord/150/usr/share/discord/Discord (31009) snap.discord.discord\n /snap/discord/150/usr/share/discord/Discord (31010) snap.discord.discord\nSorry, but it's not doing that. It's just saying what I pasted earlier. I ran only the \"sudo aa-status\" part, and now it's showing proper context. It says it's a group of processes in \"enforce mode\".\nThere still seems to be no relevant Discord file in /etc/apparmor.d/. You mentioned before that it might be dynamically creating one.\nYeah, the profile exists here. If it's not recommended to modify the profile here, how do I change it?\nWait a second. The dynamic profile generation thing. Does Snap generate that or does AppArmor?\nGot it then. So does AppArmor dynamically generate for Flatpak?\nGot it then! So it's very possible that, instead of doing all this risky file editing stuff, I could just open it via Flatpak and not have to deal with the logs anymore?\nI stopped the AI talking generation there since I can just install via Flatpak on Discover. But I'm sure the instructions would be useful to someone else. Thank you so much for all your help! I'll uninstall the Discord snap immediately, install it via Flatpak, and see if the same issues arise. Thank you for being informative! This really helps.\nWell, my 300GB /var/log/syslog still exists. Should I go ahead and delete the file?\nThanks! My system is way lighter now, haha. You helped a lot, thanks so much!\nDolphin still thinks the drive is almost full. How do I get it to recognize that it's not the case anymore?\nWhat version of Dolphin is this instruction set made for?\nHow do I check my version?\nI'm on 22.08.2. There is a \"general\" section, but no \"performance\" section.\nI'm looking for how to clean the cache so that it'll know what the proper drive size is. Not refresh interval.\nThere is no clear cache button anywhere.\nThere still is none.\nWell I don't want to remove my settings. Will it eventually resolve itself?\n\"dolphin-emu\" is for a different program, called \"Dolphin Emulator\". What I'm referring to is the Dolphin file browser for Linux on KDE.\nRelogging didn't fix it. I'll just wait for it to fix itself. I don't want to delete the cache and lose my settings like you mentioned would happen.\nWhat exactly does \"kbuildsycoca5\" do?"

Hiredly aims to connect job seekers with potential employers and to provide companies with innovative recruitment solutions.\n\nToh has extensive experience in the recruitment industry, having worked in various roles at leading companies such as Accenture and Hewlett Packard. He founded Hiredly in 2016 with the goal of transforming the way companies hire and manage talent in the digital age.\n\nUnder Toh's leadership, Hiredly has grown rapidly and has helped to streamline the recruitment process for many Malaysian companies. Toh has also been recognized for his contributions to the startup ecosystem in Malaysia, and has received awards such as the Top 40 under 40 Award by Prestige Magazine.\n\nDerek wants to teach an Online MasterClass course with a total run time of 180 minutes that includes several lessons that last between 8 to 15 minutes each. Think like an Instructional Designer, the target audience for the course is Employed Malaysia, especially those in HR positions working in small to mid sized companies that would benefit from improving Employer Branding. Should should address all the issues commonly faced by employer and pain points of the target audience. Given that this is an experience based learning masterclass, write me a 20 lesson course outline that would localise the pain points to Malaysia, factor in Derek's personal and professional; and give me bullet points of what each lesson would cover. Also, suggest some titles for the course.\nContinue\nThe Employer Brand - Bringing the Best of Brand Management to People at Work\nTell me about this book\nCan you expand on the first part of the book?\nIn the book, you mentioned the author provides a practical guide on how to develop an employer brand. Did the book talk about how to understand company's unique value proposition?\nWhy is it important for a company to develop their EVP?\nYou mentioned previously \"The authors also provide guidance on how to communicate your EVP through various channels, such as your career website, job postings, and social media. They emphasize the importance of consistency and authenticity in communicating your Employer Brand, and provide examples of organizations that have successfully done so.\" Expand on this.\nDid the book write on how to ensure consistency and authenticity when communicating your EVP\nPreviously, you mentioned \"Finally, the authors provide examples of organizations that have successfully communicated their EVP and built strong Employer Brands, such as Google, Starbucks, and Zappos. These examples serve as inspiration and can provide insights into best practices for communicating your EVP effectively.\" Can you provide an example in a Malaysian context? This organisation should be made up but yet applicable to anyone who is watching.\nI don't want a company that has already existed. Make up a company as an example, so that it is transferrable for anyone who is watching.\nAny other ways Innotech Solutions can communicate their EVP to set themselves apart from other tech startups in Malaysia?\nBased on the book, is there any step by step guide to craft your own EVP?\nBased on these points, make up an example based in Malaysia and develop their EVP.\nElaborate point 5, what are their strengths and weaknesses, and what can they improve on?\nBased on this, how can you elaborate on point 6?"

At its core, Taro taps into the security and stability of the bitcoin network and the speed, scalability, and low fees of Lightning.\nLets focus on the one I just mentioned. \n\nTell me more about it and then I'll ask you questions to check my understanding, and you'll ask me questions to test my understanding\nIs Taro used to issue assets only?\nThe assets themselves are exist as data associated with a bitcoin utxo?\nif you transfer the whole utxo, you transfer the whole supply of mycoin? \ncan you transfer a portion of the supply?\ncan you batch create assets in one utxo?\nExplain Taro from a low technical level, spliced with analogies\nExplain the protocol, using merkle sum trees ect\nSo the utxo holds the root only? And the spending condition is knowledge of the state of the tree?\nexplain the merkle proof more. Taro uses a a complex data structure, merkle sum sparse merkle tree, right?\nsparse merkle trees have efficient proofs for non inclusion. is that important for taro?\nwhat is the actual data stored at each leaf? is it like plasma cash?"

She now has to stop to rest three or four times whenever she climbs the stairs to her apartment on the third floor. She reports chronic, nonproductive cough and wheezing, for which she uses ipratropium inhalers. She has a 25 pack-year smoking history.

I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\". Judgment\n\nThese longstanding proceedings arise from the construction by the plaintiff/cross-defendant, Boulus Constructions Pty Limited (\u201cthe Builder\u201d), of a retirement village known as the Three Rivers Regional Retirement Community on behalf of the defendant/cross-claimant, Warrumbungle Shire Council (\u201cthe Council\u201d), on a former hospital site in Dunedoo.\n\nThe Builder commenced these proceedings almost four years ago, on 6 November 2018. The Builder seeks to be paid what it asserts is due for the construction work. The Council has brought a Cross-Claim alleging defective works. The Council alleges some 300 defects in total which, I was informed, comprise some 30 different kinds of defect in multiple locations in the units within the retirement village.\n\nA complex range of factual, legal and procedural issues has arisen. The matter was set down for a hearing to take place in July of last year. That hearing was vacated for a number of reasons not necessary to recite here. There is no current hearing date.\n\nOn 20 April 2022, the Builder served a Second Further Amended Technology and Construction List Statement and a Third Further Amended Technology and Construction Cross-Claim List Response. The Builder alleges that, in effect, the Council is not entitled to any remedy for the allegedly defective works in the retirement village due to the failure by the Council to obtain a valid Development Consent and Construction Certificate. The Builder had made allegations to similar effect in earlier iterations of its List Statement on what Mr Feller SC, who appeared with Mr Marshall for the Council, described as a \u201cprogressive and escalating basis\u201d.\n\nMr Feller accepted that, if the Builder makes out its allegation arising from the lack of a valid Development Consent and Construction Certificate, the Council may fail in its defective work claim. Obviously, I make no findings about that matter on this application.\n\nAgainst that possibility, by Notice of Motion filed on 4 August 2022, the Council now seeks to amend its Cross-Claim Cross-Summons and Cross-Claim List Statement (in accordance with the document circulated on 21 July 2022) to include a claim under s 37 of the Design and Building Practitioners Act 2020 (NSW) (\u201cthe Act\u201d) against the Builder itself (already a cross-defendant), as well as against the Managing Director of the Builder, Mr Brian Boulus, and the Project Site Supervisor, Mr Bradley McCarthy. Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy are not presently cross-defendants.\n\nSection 37 of the Act provides:\n\n\u201c37 Extension of duty of care\n\n(1) A person who carries out construction work has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid economic loss caused by defects\u2014\n\n(a) in or related to a building for which the work is done, and\n\n(b) arising from the construction work.\n\n(2) The duty of care is owed to each owner of the land in relation to which the construction work is carried out and to each subsequent owner of the land.\n\n(3) A person to whom the duty of care is owed is entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law.\n\n(4) The duty of care is owed to an owner whether or not the construction work was carried out\u2014\n\n(a) under a contract or other arrangement entered into with the owner or another person, or\n\n(b) otherwise than under a contract or arrangement.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\u201cConstruction work\u201d is defined in s 36 of the Act as follows:\n\n\u201cconstruction work means any of the following\u2014\n\n(a) building work,\n\n(b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work,\n\n(c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work,\n\n(d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\nSections 36 and 37 of the Act commenced operation on 10 June 2020 and have retrospective effect. [1]\n\n1. Schedule 1, s 5 of the Act.\n\nI have considered the operation of the Act in four decisions: The Owners \u2013 Strata Plan No 87060 v Loulach Developments Pty Ltd (No 2); [2] Goodwin Street Developments Pty Ltd atf Jesmond Unit Trust v DSD Builders Pty Ltd (in liq); [3] The Owners \u2013 Strata Plan No 84674 v Pafburn Pty Ltd; [4] and The Owners \u2013 Strata Plan No 84674 v Pafburn Pty Ltd (No 2). [5]\n\n2. (2021) 250 LGERA 114; [2021] NSWSC 1068.\n\n3. [2022] NSWSC 624.\n\n4. [2022] NSWSC 659.\n\n5. [2022] NSWSC 1002.\nThis is part 3 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\". I am satisfied that the Council has brought this application timeously, bearing in mind the timing of the Builder\u2019s allegations of illegality, the fact that the cause of action under s 37 has only been available since June 2020, and the relatively recent elucidation, such as it is, that my decisions have given as to the operation of the relevant provisions in the Act.\n\nMr Campbell, who appeared with Mr Khoury [6] for the Builder, submitted that the Council should nonetheless not have leave to make the proposed amendments because the claims were bound to fail for two reasons.\n\n6. Mr Khoury appearing with leave.\n\nThe \u201cdefence of illegality\u201d\n\nFirst, Mr Campbell submitted that by reason of the absence of Development Consent and a Construction Certificate, the building work was \u201cillegal\u201d and the Builder would have a complete \u201cdefence of illegality\u201d to the claim under s 37 of the Act.\n\nMr Campbell relied on the principles discussed by the High Court of Australia in Miller v Miller. [7]\n\n7. (2011) 242 CLR 446; [2011] HCA 9.\n\nIn that case, the Court considered whether a participant in a joint criminal enterprise owed an accomplice a duty to drive with care a car in the course of that criminal enterprise.\n\nIn that context, the Court [8] posed the question of:\n\n\u201c\u2026 whether it is incongruous for the law to provide that the driver should not be using the vehicle at all and yet say that, if the driver and another jointly undertake the crime of using a vehicle illegally, the driver owes the confederate a duty to use it carefully when neither should be using it at all.\u201d [9]\n\n8. French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ; Heydon J agreeing although dissenting on the facts.\n\n9. At [73].\n\nIn my opinion, this authority does not assist the Builder. Although the Court used the expression \u201cdefence of illegality\u201d, [10] what the Court was considering was whether, in the circumstances before it, a duty should be held to arise at all. [11]\n\n10. For example, at [37] and [39].\n\n11. See, for example, [70], [101] and [108]; see also the observations of Leeming JA in Bevan v Coolahan at (2019) 101 NSWLR 86; [2019] NSWCA 217 at [45].\n\nThat question does not arise here because, by s 37 of the Act, the Parliament has stated that there is a duty.\n\nAs Leeming JA explained in Bevan v Coolahan:\n\n\u201c\u2026 Statute can always modify or abrogate common law. The rules governing the effect of illegality upon a claim in tort as stated in Miller v Miller \u2013 which operate to diminish the scope of a duty of care in the face of an inconsistent or incoherent criminal statute \u2013 are themselves rules of common law, which may be modified by statute.\u201d [12]\n\n12. At [66].\n\nLeeming JA then referred to s 54 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) which provides that the Court is not to award damages in certain circumstances involving the commission of a \u201cserious offence\u201d. Leeming JA said that \u201cs 54 is such a statute\u201d. Section 37 of the Act is also \u201csuch a statute\u201d.\n\nI cannot see how the alleged fact that the building work was performed in breach of provisions of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), [13] and thus \u201cillegally\u201d, can affect the existence of the statutory duty prescribed by s 37 of the Act. Whether or not such \u201cillegality\u201d affects the relief to which the Council may be entitled were it to establish a breach of that duty is not a matter that arises on this application.\n\n13. Mr Campbell referred to ss 76A, 81A(2)(a) and 109E(3)(a).\n\nAccordingly, I do not see the \u201cillegality\u201d alleged by the Builder in this matter to be, itself, a reason to deny the Council the leave it now seeks.\nThis is part 4 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\". Whether Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy are \u201cpersons\u201d for the purposes of s 37\n\nAlternatively, Mr Campbell submitted that Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy are not \u201cpersons\u201d for the purposes of s 37 of the Act.\n\nNeither Mr Boulus nor Mr McCarthy is currently a party to the proceedings. Mr Campbell did not appear for Mr McCarthy. Mr Campbell did not dispute that the Builder itself is a \u201cperson\u201d for the purposes of s 37 of the Act.\n\nIn Pafburn, I held that a person \u201chaving substantive control over the carrying out of any work\u201d for the purpose of cl (d) of the definition of \u201cconstruction work\u201d in s 36(1) of the Act included a person able to control how the work was carried out. [14]\n\n14. At [26].\n\nIn the proposed Technology and Construction Cross-Claim List Statement, the Council alleges that Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy were both able to, and in fact did, exercise control over the carrying out of the building work.\n\nThus, it is alleged that:\n\n\u201c \u2026 [i]n his capacity as the managing director of [the Builder], [Mr Boulus] had the power and ability to and did substantively control all of the building works comprising the entire project, such control including the appointment and control of the project delivery staff working for [the Builder] (including the appointment and control of [Mr McCarthy]), the supervision of the adequacy of the works performed by such project delivery staff, the selection and appointment of subcontractors to perform elements of the Works for which [the Builder] was ultimately responsible, and the overall supervision and acceptance of the works performed by [the Builder\u2019s] employees and subcontractors, for the ultimate benefit of [the Council]. Further, as the managing director of [the Builder], [Mr Boulus] had the ultimate ability to control how the Works performed by [the Builder] were carried out.\u201d\n\nIn relation to Mr McCarthy, it is alleged:\n\n\u201cAs the site supervisor for the Project, [Mr McCarthy] actively supervised, coordinated and project managed all of the primary elements of the building works comprising the project, and coordinated and directed how the Works performed by [the Builder] were carried out, including by directing and engaging with [the Builder\u2019s] subcontractors in the performance of their works.\u201d\n\nMr Campbell pointed to the potentially wide-ranging consequences of construing \u201cpersons\u201d in s 37 to cover a director of a builder, such as Mr Boulus, or an employee of a builder, such as Mr McCarthy.\n\nThus, Mr Campbell submitted:\n\n\u201cEvery person on a construction site has substantive control or supervision over some building work performed at that site, often the work that they themselves directly perform, and accordingly, taking section 37 at its broadest interpretation, every such person could potentially come within the ambit of a \u2018person who carries out construction work\u2019, and be the subject of an automatic statutory duty of care to the current and future owners of a project where no such duty previously existed. Such a broad interpretation could make hundreds, or on a very large job even thousands, of people personally liable in respect of the construction work over which they have control or supervision, which would have far reaching and negative impacts on the construction industry.\n\nWhen one considers the fact that construction cases often involve claims for hundreds of defects, which may involve the work of multiple subcontractors, consultants, and supervisors in addition to employees and officers of the builder, a broad interpretation of section 37 would also result in building cases that balloon to include huge numbers of defendants, increasing the cost and complexity of what is already a costly and complex area of litigation. This is especially so when one considers the potential for the defence of proportionate liability that can be pleaded in defence of a claim under [the Act] to raise the same issues of liability of multiple third parties even if the plaintiff does not join all potential defendants to their claim.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\nIn those circumstances, Mr Campbell submitted that \u201cpersons\u201d should be construed more narrowly.\n\nMr Campbell submitted that the reference in s 37 to a \u201cperson\u201d who carries out \u201cconstruction work\u201d, when read with the definition of \u201cconstruction work\u201d in s 36, is:\n\n\u201c\u2026 obviously intended to refer to more than just a builder, and by reference to their function encompasses roles such as the architect, the project manager, the design consultants and possibly sub-contractors\u2026\u201d.\n\nMr Campbell submitted that \u201cperson\u201d should be construed as \u201ca person who carries out construction work in their own capacity\u201d, and as not including a person who acts as agent for another.\n\nIn the Second Reading Speech [15] delivered by the Minister on introduction of the Design and Building Practitioners Bill 2019, the Minister said that the Bill was designed \u201cto introduce a suite of new obligations on design and building practitioners to ensure that each step of construction is well documented and compliant\u201d. The Minister continued that the Bill introduces \u201ca number of new requirements, which will ensure that key practitioners are held accountable for their work across planning, design and construction stages.\u201d\n\n15. New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 19 November 2019 at 1776 (Damien Tudehope, Minister for Finance and Small Business).\n\nThe Minister also said, speaking of the clause in the Bill that became s 37 of the Act:\n\n\u201cFor the first time in New South Wales, [s 37] establishes a statutory duty of care that eradicates any uncertainty that may exist in the common law that a duty is owed to the end user and in respect to liability for defective building work. Any person who carries out construction work will, under the provisions of the bill and for the first time, have an automatic duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid economic loss caused by defects in or related to a building for which the construction work is done or arising out of that work.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nAs the Minister, here, did no more than recite the language of the relevant clause, this passage casts no light on the question before me.\n\nThe \u201cuncertainty\u201d to which the Minister referred arose from the decision of the High Court in Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners Corporation Strata Plan 61288. [16] In that case, the Court found that, in the particular circumstances before it, the owners corporation could not maintain a claim in negligence against the builder as successor in title to the developer. It is true, as Mr Campbell submitted, that the case was not concerned with the owners corporation\u2019s claim against directors and employees of the builder but rather whether any action lay against the builder at all. However, I do not see what light that casts on the question of whether \u201cowner\u201d in s 37 extends to such directors and employees.\n\n16. (2014) 254 CLR 185; [2014] HCA 36 (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ).\n\nUltimately, the question as to the meaning to be given to \u201cperson\u201d in the expression in s 37 \u201ca person who carries out construction work\u201d requires that careful attention be paid to the words used in the Act.\n\nThe Act deals with the obligations and registration of the \u201cpractitioners\u201d to which the Minister referred.\n\n\u201cPractitioner\u201d is defined in the Act to mean:\n\n\u201c\u2026 a design practitioner, principal design practitioner, professional engineer, specialist practitioner or building practitioner.\u201d [17]\nThis is part 5 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n17. Section 3.\n\nEach of the expressions in that definition is itself defined in the Act.\n\nA \u201cdesign practitioner\u201d is defined to be a \u201cperson who prepares regulated designs\u201d. [18] Division 1 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the \u201cobligations of design practitioners\u201d including the making of \u201cdesign compliance declaration[s]\u201d [19] or \u201cfurther design compliance declaration[s]\u201d. [20]\n\n18. Ibid.\n\n19. Section 9(1); \"design compliance declaration[s]\u201d are defined in s 8(1).\n\n20. Sections 9(2) and (3).\n\nA \u201cprincipal design practitioner\u201d is defined to be a \u201cperson who coordinates the provision of design compliance declarations for the purposes of building work done by a building practitioner\u201d. [21] Division 2 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the \u201cobligations of principal design practitioners\u201d. The Act provides that \u201ca person must not make a principal compliance declaration\u201d unless that \u201cperson\u201d is a \u201cregistered principal design practitioner\u201d under the Act. [22]\n\n21. Section 3; \"building practitioner\" is defined in s 7.\n\n22. Section 13.\n\nA \u201cprofessional engineer\u201d is defined to mean \u201ca person who carries out professional engineering work in a prescribed area of engineering within the meaning of section 32\u201d, [23] that is, relevantly, structural, civil, mechanical, fire safety or electrical engineering. [24] Such a \u201cperson\u201d must not carry out professional engineering work unless that \u201cperson\u201d is a \u201cregistered professional engineer\u201d under the Act. [25]\n\n23. Section 3.\n\n24. Section 32(3).\n\n25. Section 32.\n\nA \u201cspecialist practitioner\u201d is defined to mean \u201ca person who carries out specialist work\u201d [26] which, in turn, is defined to mean, relevantly, \u201cthe design, construction, installation or maintenance of a building element\u201d. [27] Such a \u201cperson\u201d must not carry out specialist work unless that \u201cperson\u201d is a \u201cregistered specialist practitioner\u201d under the Act. [28]\n\n26. Section 3.\n\n27. Section 34.\n\n28. Section 35.\n\nA \u201cbuilding practitioner\u201d is defined to be \u201ca person who agrees under a contract or other arrangement to do building work\u201d or \u201cif more than one person agrees to do building work, a person who is the principal contractor for the work\u201d. [29] Division 3 of Pt 2 of the Act deals with the \u201cobligations of building practitioners\u201d.\n\n29. Sections 3 and 7.\n\nThere is a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout an Act in which it appears, although it has been said that the presumption is \u201cof the mildest kind\u201d and \u201creadily yields to the context\u201d. [30]\n\n30. P Herzfeld and T Prince, Interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, Thomson Reuters) at [5.170] and the cases there cited.\n\n\u201cPerson\u201d is not defined in the Act. In particular, the Act does not define \u201cpersons\u201d to include or be \u201cpractitioners\u201d. By reason of s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) \u201cperson\u201d includes a body corporate.\n\nIn the provisions I have set out, \u201cpersons\u201d who carry out particular functions are deemed to be \u201cpractitioners\u201d of one kind or other for the purposes of the Act. These provisions thus contemplate that \u201cpersons\u201d will also be \u201cpractitioners\u201d if they carry out work of the kind described.\n\nThere are other provisions of the Act where reference is made to \u201cpersons\u201d who, because of the context in which they are referred, could not be \u201cpractitioners\u201d.\n\nFor example, s 9(1) provides that a registered design practitioner must provide a design compliance declaration \u201cto a person\u201d in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) provides that \u201ca person\u201d must, before making an application for an occupation certificate, give written notice to the relevant \u201cregistered building practitioner who did the building work\u201d. Section 29(3) provides that \u201ca person\u201d must not unduly influence, or attempt to unduly influence, a \u201cregistered practitioner\u201d for the purpose of prevailing on the practitioner to act otherwise than impartially. It is obvious that the \u201cperson\u201d referred to in these provisions is not a \u201cpractitioner\u201d for the purposes of the Act.\n\nThus the word \u201cpersons\u201d is sometimes used in the Act to mean a person deemed to be a \u201cpractitioner\u201d; and sometimes it is not.\n\nIn the critical part of the Act, Pt 4 (entitled \u201cDuty of care\u201d), there are a number of references to a \u201cperson\u201d other than the \u201cperson\u201d having the statutory duty under s 37(1) to carry out construction work with reasonable care.\n\nThus, each of ss 37(3) and 41(2) speak of the \u201cperson\u201d to whom the statutory duty is owed. Section 37(3) provides that such a \u201cperson\u201d is \u201centitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law\u201d. Section 41(2) provides that nothing in Pt 4 of the Act limits \u201cdamages or other compensation that may be available\u201d to such a \u201cperson under another Act or at common law\u201d.\n\nThe references in Pt 4 to the \u201cperson\u201d owing the statutory duty are in ss 37 and 41(2), to which I have just referred, as well as s 39, which provides that \u201c[a] person who owes a duty of care under this Part is not entitled to delegate that duty\u201d.\n\nAs I have stated above, the definition of \u201cconstruction work\u201d is:\n\n\u201cconstruction work means any of the following\u2014\n\n(a) building work,\n\n(b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work,\n\n(c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work,\n\n(d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\nThe definition, at (a), refers to \u201cbuilding work\u201d and thus to work that a \u201cbuilding practitioner\u201d would undertake.\n\nThe definition then, at (b), refers to the preparation of \u201cdesigns \u2026 for building work\u201d and thus to work that a \u201cdesign practitioner\u201d or a \u201cprincipal design practitioner\u201d would undertake.\n\nThe definition then refers, at (c), to the \u201cmanufacture or supply of a building product\u201d for use in building work. In that regard, s 36(4) provides that \u201ca person who carries out construction work includes a reference to a person who manufactures, or is a supplier \u2026 of, a building product used for building work\u201d. That \u201cperson\u201d could only be the manufacturer or supplier itself.\n\nFinally, the definition of \u201cconstruction work\u201d refers at (d) to the supervision, coordination and project management or having substantive control over the carrying out of \u201cany\u201d work referred to in the three previous elements of the definition; that is \u201cany\u201d \u201cbuilding work\u201d, \u201cany\u201d \u201cpreparation of \u2026 designs\u201d and \u201cany\u201d \u201cmanufacture or supply of a building product\u201d.\n\nThe potential ambit of this aspect of the definition of \u201cconstruction work\u201d is wide. It necessarily encompasses a wider range of activity than is described in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It also contemplates a wider range of actors carrying out those activities. Relevantly, the supervision, coordination, project management and having substantive control over building work could be effected by a wide range of actors. The word the Parliament has used to determine who those actors are is \u201cperson\u201d. I am unable to see by what process of statutory interpretation that word could be read down to mean a person acting \u201cin their own capacity\u201d. That would, in effect, involve reading \u201cperson\u201d in s 37(1) as meaning \u201cpractitioner\u201d. Although, as I have said, Parliament has taken care to define \u201cpractitioner\u201d and to define the various activities within that definition by reference to \u201cpersons\u201d carrying out those activities, it has used the expression \u201cperson\u201d in s 37(1). That must mean someone who is not necessarily a \u201cpractitioner\u201d and not necessarily a person acting in their capacity as a \u201cpractitioner\u201d; nor necessarily acting \u201cin their own capacity\u201d. As I said in Pafburn, [31] this will be a question of fact in each case.\nThis is part 6 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\". \n\n31. At [26].\n\nIt is true, as Mr Campbell pointed out, that the Minister, referring to the provisions in the Bill that became ss 39 and 40 of the Act, [32] said:\n\n\u201cThe bill continues to safeguard the rights of owners through [ss 39 and 40] by preventing a person who performs construction work from delegating or contracting of their duty.\n\nThis is important, as practitioners will need to accept individual and collective responsibility for their work.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\n32. Which provide that a person who owes a duty of care under s 37 may not delegate that duty and that no contract can vary or exclude the duty.\n\nMr Campbell submitted that the Minister\u2019s reference in this passage to \u201cpractitioners\u201d rather than \u201cpersons\u201d suggests that Parliament\u2019s intention was that s 37 \u201cwas intended to apply primarily to practitioners\u201d. That may be so. But the fact is that the word used in s 37(1) is \u201cperson\u201d, not \u201cpractitioner\u201d.\n\nThe Act is expressed to be subject to the Civil Liability Act. [33] The proportionate liability regime under Pt 4 of the Civil Liability Act thus applies to actions for breach of the s 37 statutory duty. This enables persons in the position of Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy to identify concurrent wrongdoers and seek to have their liability for breach of the statutory duty limited under s 35 of the Civil Liability Act. This appears to be the means by which Parliament has sought to address the matters to which Mr Campbell referred, as set out at [30] above.\n\n33. Section 41(3) of the Act.\n\nAccordingly, I do not see the Council\u2019s proposed identification of Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy as \u201cpersons\u201d for the purposes of s 37 of the Act to be a reason to refuse it leave to make the amendments sought.\n\n\u201cConflict of laws\u201d\n\nMr Campbell also submitted that \u201cthe automatic duty owed by directors of building companies is relevantly in conflict with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and in particular sections 119, 124 and 516 and the definition of \u2018a company limited by shares\u2019 in section 9\u201d. Those sections deal with the questions of when a company comes into existence (s 119), the legal capacity and powers of the company (s 124) and the obligations of contributories in a company limited by shares (s 516). I am unable to see what relevance those sections have to the issues here.\n\nMr Campbell also submitted that the imposition on \u201ccompany directors\u201d of the \u201cautomatic duty\u201d under s 37 \u201cis contrary to the independence of a corporation from its directors and members, a central [tenet] of corporations legislation\u201d. Mr Campbell did not develop that submission. I do not see how s 37 has any such consequence. The duty imposed on a director of the company who engages in \u201cconstruction work\u201d by s 37 is the same duty as is imposed on the company itself.\n\nPrejudice\n\nI accept that some prejudice will be caused to the Builder, as well as to Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy, by granting the Council leave to make the amendment it proposes.\n\nMr Campbell submitted that:\n\n\u201cBoulus Constructions, unlike the Council, is a small privately owned company that does not have the resources of the Council to undertake protracted and costly litigation.\u201d\n\nHowever, my attention was not drawn to any evidence adduced by the Builder to this effect.\n\nI will order that the Council pay the Builder\u2019s costs thrown away by the proposed amendment.\n\nIt is apparent that the Builder will incur further costs to adduce evidence to meet the Council\u2019s case now being formulated as a breach of duty under s 37 of the Act.\n\nI will invite submissions from the parties as to what, if any, orders I should make concerning those costs.\n\nConclusion\n\nI grant the Council the leave it seeks to amend its Cross-Claim Cross-Summons and Cross-Claim List Statement.\n\nI direct that the Council file and serve its Further Amended First Cross-Claim Cross-Summons in the form annexed as \u201cExhibit BV-02\u201d to the affidavit of Brett Kenneth Vincent affirmed 4 August 2022 and the Third Further Amended Technology and Construction List Cross-Claim List Statement in the form annexed as \"Exhibit BV-03\" to the affidavit of Brett Kenneth Vincent affirmed 24 August 2022, by 5.00pm on 14 October 2022.\n\nI direct that the Builder serve and provide by email to my Associate its submissions as to the costs orders it contends I should make arising from the amendments by 5.00 pm on 14 October 2022 and that the Council serve and provide by email to my Associate submissions in reply by 5.00 pm on 21 October 2022.\n\nI stand the matter over for further directions on 28 October 2022 before the Technology and Construction List Judge.\nThis is my last message that forms part of the case, Boulus Constructions Pty Ltd v Warrumbungle Shire Council (No 2) [2022] NSWSC 1368.

        "prompt": "foreign hi guys I'm Laura Vitale I'm already uh in motion here on this episode of learning kitchen we are making something that you guys have asked me about a million times Mississippi pot roast but what makes mine different is that we are not using packets we are not using a packet of ranch we are not using a packet of our Zoo because you do not need it if you have got a spice cabinet with garlic and onion and oregano and Thyme and you've got beef stock on hand and pepperoncinis and Worcestershire sauce you do not need it we will thicken the gravy part later it is so good so delicious and I if you want to use a packet stuff by all means use a packet of each but the reason why I try not to because first of all I don't want to buy anything that I don't have to because the grocery bill these days is adding a level of stress I don't need you know what I just realized I just realized I'm gonna go pepperless right now because my pepper grinder is upstairs but that's fine um but for those of you that watch me from all over the world and you don't have access to packets of ranch packets of all that you don't need them it's going to be so delicious you're going to thicken up the gravy later and it is so luscious you're going to love it I'm gonna just simmer mine uh slow cook it on my stovetop in my little small Dutch oven if you want to put this in the crock pot please sear your pot roast first there's nothing more frustrating than when people make a recipe when it comes to any kind of meat and they don't sear it first you get like gray meat that has no flavor on it and that doesn't have good color on it and color equals flavor so do yourself a favor and see where first all right let's see what she looks like I'm using my little tiny Dutch oven and I always love using it makes me feel I don't know not there yet you see this I want that to be way deeper in color nobody wants No Gray meat nobody wants gray meat so let that go in the meantime I have thinly sliced some yellow onion and some garlic again these are flavors you'd find in a packet but why why you know you got onion you know you got some garlic you know you got some herbs you know you got some Worcestershire sauce you're good let's just do its thing though I don't want to rush it much better much much better I'm actually not gonna bother taking it out because I don't need to so I'm gonna scatter the onion because remember this is gonna cook a long time and the garlic around in about three to four minutes that bottom side will be a beautiful golden brown and then we'll add the remaining ingredients gorgeous now if you're making this in your crock pot okay this is the point where you would take the beef out and you put it in the crock pot with some stock you don't want as much stock as I'm using you're going to want to use a lot less of it so about I'm using a quarter one and a quarter cups but you would want to use I'm actually using whatever on the copper but you would want to use like a half a cup some Worcestershire Worcestershire it's a good flavor some dried oregano thyme onion garlic all the goods I don't know why people use a stick of butter you do not need a full stick of butter won't tell me trust me a couple of tablespoons will do the job just fine pepperoncini are a non-negotiable I think these are what makes this so dangling delicious so good so I'm gonna add about I don't know six or seven but that's really up to you how spicy do you want it okay to me I really can't get enough about a tablespoon or two of the pickle juice of the pepperoncini juice I'm gonna slow simmer this covered partially covered just like that for a few hours I want that meat to be falling apart once it's there I'm going to show you how I thicken it and it is going to be so Sublime and it's so easy right and your whole house is going to smell fantastic and you have a multitude of ways that you can serve it you can make sandwiches with it like a drip beef sandwich you can serve it as a roast with it thick and delicious gravy The Cider Mash or egg noodles to me that's like the ultimate winter comfort food but the world is your pickle my roast has been cooking for hours and I just want you to see how like look at this I just have two forks I got nothing fancy and I just literally falls apart it is so tender look at this so tender and gorgeous now let me give you options because life is full of options I did take out a big piece of fat though if you're gonna make sandwiches like beef and drip beef sandwiches you shred the meat mix some of the the juice with the meat so it stays nice and moist then serve that sort of brothy goodness on the side for Duncan okay if however you want to serve this as a roast as a traditional sort of pot roast over mashed potato egg noodles you need that juice to thick it to be thicker right now if you're doing this with the packet stuff you're not going to need to do this because it will thicken it up for you but all you need to do is make a cornstarch slurry slurry which is cornstarch and cold water it looks like this you add it in in about a minute or two that will have thickened um if you want it super super thick you can do heavier cornstarch slurry I don't like it super thick just not the vibe um but I'm just going to let this go this is fantastic like I said over mashed potato I mean it's sort of a must it's so delicious but once this thickens slightly we're gonna top it with some fresh parsley I've already tasted it and it tastes so good that brothy goodness is so insanely delicious it's next level so once that thickens just a bit then we're ready to serve see how much thicker that's gotten I'm gonna turn it off add fresh parsley you need it now listen I've said this to you before I will say it again a pot roast a stew anything like that is never going to be the prettiest thing you ever make it's just not I take it from me it's very difficult to photograph because my job is to make it look appetizing to you and I know that this doesn't look particularly appetizing unless you are somebody that has been an eater her whole life and you cook and you just know that when you see something like this it means flavor it means fall apart in your mouth it means tender it means oh the world is just a better place because this isn't it okay now you're gonna have to give me a second this is hot and I don't have a plate near me I have this one okay um it literally melts in your mouth super delicious spicy but not so spicy that it leaves you feeling like oh you can taste is from heat it's delicious that sauce look how perfectly thick that is your egg noodles are calling your mashed potato is calling you are ready for supper learn in the kitchen uncomfortable recipe hope you enjoy spending time with me and I will see you in the next one bye [Music]\nwrite a High CTR Meta Description for this article that is no more than 156 characters, and

While that may be true, especially for those who love spending their time reading, traveling and spending quality time with their loved ones, there\u2019s one thing you need to remember \u2013 being retired means that you\u2019re not as young as you used to be. And that also means that you\u2019re surrounded by different illnesses and health issues that might ruin your day and jeopardize your well-being more than you can imagine. This is why it\u2019s essential to protect your health as much as you can and remain as safe and covered as possible, and if that\u2019s something you\u2019d like to do as well, here are a few things to consider.\n\nProtect your teeth\nEven though this might not sound like the biggest problem in the world, you need to know that teeth-related issues can lead to serious problems with other parts of your body down the line. From your kidneys to your heart and everything in between, lots of different organs are closely connected to your teeth, which is why protecting them is such a big deal. Luckily, you can do quite a lot on your own if you know what to do and what to pay attention to. For instance, there are several issues you need to stop ignoring, from tooth pain to bleeding gums, and you simply have to react as soon as you notice that something might be wrong. The same goes for loose or crooked teeth, so make sure you visit your dentist the minute you start experiencing pain and don\u2019t wait too long \u2013 or it might be too late!\n\nProtect your kidneys\nThis is another common issue that has been bothering retirees for ages, but the problem is that most people just give up trying to get their kidneys in order after a while. However, you should never give up on your kidneys, but you need to keep on fighting and looking for solutions that might help you. Dialysis is one of those ideas and just because it\u2019s a hard, complex, and usually unpleasant treatment doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s ineffective. On the contrary, regular dialysis can change your life and make you healthier than before, and the best thing about this approach is that you can do it anywhere you want. You can even book a treatment when you\u2019re on the road, and the only thing you need to do is to check out bookdialysis.com, a practical dialysis website that can help you do that and book your dialysis for you. These are particularly useful if you\u2019re one of those retirees that love spending time in the open, so make sure you research these websites before you hit the road next time!\n\nProtect your liver\nAfter you retire, you\u2019ll probably want to spend some time away from your previous life and everything that might remind you of it. This means you\u2019ll want to spend some time with your family and friends, eating, drinking, and enjoying life. However, you need to be careful and remember not to eat or drink too much \u2013 just because you\u2019ve retired doesn\u2019t mean that you need to destroy your liver! In case you need some time taking care of your liver, you can do most of these things on your own \u2013 just find out what suits you and what doesn\u2019t, and then continue having a great time without endangering your liver in the process.\n\nProtect your mental health\nIn the end, this is one of those things that very few people pay attention to after they retire because they feel that nothing can go wrong once they take this step and stop going to work every single day. While this may be true for some people, it\u2019s definitely not the same for everyone, and you\u2019d be surprised to learn that tons of people have a problem staying at home after being employed for decades. This might impact their mental health and play games with their mind, and if you wish to be fine yourself, you have to work on your mental health and protect it at all costs. Fortunately, doing that is easier than you can imagine \u2013 just start doing all the things you love doing and try to be as positive as you can. You can also discover new hobbies and ways to spend your time, from playing video games to hiking or swimming. This is going to help you get your mental health in order and that\u2019s something you can\u2019t put a price on!\n\nProtecting your health after you retire can be quite hard, and doing all these things is going to turn into a challenging process. But, if you wish to enjoy your retirement to the fullest, this is precisely what you need to do, so start taking these things into consideration and become the healthier retiree in your area!\nWrite a twitter thread form this content: Why It\u2019s Never Too Late to Start a Business + 6 Amazing Business Ideas\nAugust 2, 2022 By Eileen Williams Leave a Comment\n\nThe number of new business applications in the US in 2021 was almost 5.4 million. And while this number may seem gigantic, it just shows that people are prepared to take a leap of faith and invest in business ideas that spark joy.\n\nNow, if you\u2019ve been toying with the idea of starting a business but you\u2019re worried that it might be too late, don\u2019t fret. There are plenty of reasons why you should still consider doing it.\n\nYou Have Unique (and Extensive) Experience\nOne of the main benefits of starting a business when you\u2019re over fifty is your experience.\n\nSure, many people think that doing something new or out of the ordinary at a later stage in life is too risky. However, the truth is that there\u2019s nothing more valuable when starting a new business than having a few years under your belt.\n\nYes, you may need to work harder to keep up with trends when targeting a younger audience. But you\u2019ve also got a lay of the land in your field of expertise. And that means that your business decisions are bound to be evidence or experience-based \u2014 which is one of the best ways to guarantee success.\n\nGreat Ideas Are Timeless\nYour age is just a number in the business world. Especially if you\u2019ve got a great idea. So, if you\u2019ve got one, why not share it with the world?\n\nSure, you may not hit the jackpot right away. But if you know you\u2019ve got something special, don\u2019t hesitate to stick with it. After all, even giants like Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, and J. K. Rowling struggled before the world was finally prepared to embrace their visions.\n\nYou Have Connections\nAnother valuable asset that older entrepreneurs have at their disposal is that they have connections. And the best part is that these don\u2019t even have to be proper business connections.\n\nPerhaps you have a friend whose experience in a particular niche could help you get your idea off the ground? Maybe you\u2019ve met an angel investor on vacation who\u2019d be willing to hear your pitch? You may even have a support system behind you with people ready to put in their time and effort to help you launch a new business.\n\nYou Know How to Set (Realistic) Goals\nYouth is great. But it\u2019s also a time of inexperience, wanting things too fast, too soon, and not knowing how to pace yourself.\n\nLuckily, after you\u2019ve reached a certain point in life, you\u2019ve (hopefully) gained the wisdom and patience to allow yourself to slow down.\n\nYou see, when starting any business, the most challenging thing you\u2019ll have to do is set your goals. And if you don\u2019t know how to be realistic, you\u2019ll never be able to reach them. Or, worse yet, burn yourself out trying to do something impossible.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re considering starting a new business late in life, make sure that you listen to your gut. Be prepared to prioritize sustainability over unreachable dreams. And be realistic about the amount of work you\u2019re willing to put in.\n\nRemember, a side job or passive income that gives you something to do a few hours per day might just be more fulfilling than slaving away at a startup 80 hours per week.\n\nChoosing a Business Idea: Why Passion is Key\nIf you don\u2019t already have a business idea you\u2019d be willing to explore, you might find yourself feeling lost. After all, how, exactly, do you identify the thing that will bring you satisfaction and success?\n\nWell, truth be told, the answer is quite simple: go with whatever you\u2019re passionate about. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated at all. The only thing that matters is that you understand the industry, your potential customers\u2019 frustrations and that you\u2019re willing to learn through the process.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a passionate golfer, you might consider doing something that has to do with the sport. This is what the team at Golf Cart Tire Supply did, deciding to help fellow golf aficionados source and maintain their golf accessories.\n\nOr, if you love flowers, you could look up to Robbie from boo\u2022kay, who decided to use his downtime during the 2020 health crisis in New York to pursue flower arranging.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re an avid baker, you might even choose to start your own baking business. All you need to do is open up an Instagram profile, take some photos of your lovely creations, and add some contact details. It\u2019s fascinating how quickly these types of services can get off the ground, resting on nothing more than social proof.\n\nAre you tech-savvy and want to reach younger audiences? Why not channel your inner Julia Child and start a cooking YouTube channel, as done by BBQ Pit Boys?\n\nOr put your mentorship skills to use by creating an online course?\n\nYou might even see success by doing something as simple as starting your own blog.\n\nConclusion\nStarting a business is something you can do at any stage of your life. And the great thing is, what will determine your potential level of success won\u2019t be your age. Much more importantly, it will be your passion, dedication, and willingness to combine previous experience with newly attained knowledge.\n\n So, if you\u2019re looking for new professional opportunities, do not hesitate. Instead, bite the bullet and give your dream a try. Who knows, you might just find that it\u2019s precisely the thing you need.\nwrite carrousel in the style of Naval Ravikant form this content: Important Daily Wellness Tips for Women Age 65 and Older\nAugust 9, 2022 By Eileen Williams Leave a Comment\n\nAs we age, taking care of our bodies and minds becomes even more vital. Women over 65 have unique health needs and concerns, and it\u2019s crucial to address them to maintain our well-being. Here are nine tips for staying healthy and happy as a woman over 65:\n\nGet active\nOne of the best things you can do for your health at any age is to get active and stay active. Regular physical activity has countless benefits, including reducing your risk of chronic diseases, improving your mental health and mood, and helping you to maintain a healthy weight. If you\u2019re not used to being active, start slowly and build up gradually. There are many ways to get moving, so find an activity you enjoy and stick with it.\n\nFind New Activities You Love\nJust because you\u2019re getting older doesn\u2019t mean you have to slow down. It\u2019s essential to keep your mind and body active as you age. Finding new activities to love can help you stay physically and mentally sharp. Whether taking up a new sport, trying a new exercise class, or simply exploring your local area on foot or by bike, adding some variety to your life can help keep you young and vibrant.\n\nEat a Balanced Diet\nEating a healthy, balanced diet is vital at any age, but it\u2019s imperative as we age. As we age, our bodies become less efficient at absorbing nutrients from food, so it\u2019s essential to eat foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help keep your mind and body sharp. Mindful eating is a great way to improve your relationship with food. It\u2019s about paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations when you eat. When mindful of your eating habits, you\u2019re more likely to make healthier choices and be more aware of your hunger cues. Mindful eating can also help you to enjoy your food.\n\nGet Better Sleep\nGetting enough quality sleep is crucial for our overall health and well-being. As we age, our sleep patterns often change, and we may need less sleep than we did when we were younger. However, it\u2019s still important to get seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. If you find yourself having trouble sleeping, there are a few things you can do to improve your sleep quality, such as establishing a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine before bed, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n\nTry Tai Chi or Yoga\nTai chi and yoga are two excellent mind-body practices that can help maintain your health as you age. Tai chi is a slow, gentle martial arts form involving flowing movements and deep breathing. It\u2019s been shown to improve balance and reduce stress. Yoga is another excellent way to reduce stress and improve your flexibility and strength. There are many different types of yoga, so there\u2019s sure to be one perfect for you.\n\nLearn how to manage stress\nStress is a normal part of life, but it can take a toll on our physical and mental health if we don\u2019t manage it well. Learning how to identify and cope with stress in healthy ways is an integral part of maintaining your well-being as you age. Some helpful stress management techniques include yoga, meditation, and deep exercises.\n\nSchedule annual physicals\nIt\u2019s essential to stay up-to-date on your health as you age. Schedule annual physicals and screenings, such as mammograms, Pap smears, and colonoscopies. These can help detect problems early when they\u2019re most treatable. It\u2019s also a good idea to know your family medical history and to share it with your doctor. This can help them identify any health conditions for which you may be at risk.\n\nImprove Your Mindset\nYour mindset plays a significant role in how you age. If you believe that getting older means you\u2019re automatically becoming frail and unhealthy, that\u2019s likely what will happen. But if you take a more positive view of aging and see it as an opportunity to improve your health and well-being, you\u2019re more likely to age gracefully. Change your mindset and change your life!\n\n \n\nChallenge Your Mind\nOne of the best ways to keep your mind sharp as you age is to challenge it regularly. Try new things, learn new skills, and take on new challenges. This can help keep your mind active and prevent age-related cognitive decline. Additionally, social activities can also help keep your mind sharp. So don\u2019t forget to stay connected with family and friends.\n\nConclusion\nYou can do many things to maintain your health as you age. Eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and managing stress are all important. And don\u2019t forget to schedule annual physicals and screenings. You can age gracefully by caring for yourself and enjoying a higher quality of life. So what are you waiting for?

Pero despu\u00e9s de generado en ingl\u00e9s piden traducir a espa\u00f1ol y listo.\nCopi\u00e9 todo en bruto sin control de calidad.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zjDWlIAOj9NBoPTASltX5ufpG7KjK826jIoNGOKfFIE/edit#heading=h.d0e11175ynd6\n\nSi alguien lo va a tomar y a hacer. Hay varios truquitos que voy aprendiendo y les puedo pasar. Para el estilo, como preguntar o darle contenido del cual generar los textos.\nAl margen de los trucos se mejora mucho la calidad cuando empez\u00e1s a meterte en la tem\u00e1tica y a preguntar mas profundo por cada cosa. La clave est\u00e1 en que cosas preguntar. Si es un tema que manejas es mucho mas natural, si es como este tipo de temas hay que hacer un primer esfuerzo.\u00a0Empezamos por algo superficial y despu\u00e9s ir profundizando. Pasada esa barrera se puede generar 100s de estos textos en un d\u00eda y tener stock para 1 a\u00f1o.\nDescribe the characteristics of Naval Ravikant"

Coudl you slim that list down now you know that?\nAre you aware of midjourney, Dall-E and stablediffusion?\nGreat. At this point, those systems have developed to the point where it's relatively straightforward to generate realistic images of humans given a text prompt and some time. I perceive that my technology will only be useful in cases where avatars are already in use, or where control is needed over the shape or pose of the avatar. Does my tech have other advantages? Could you slim the list down further to the situations where it will be easier / better to create an avatar and then use my tech, rather than using generative art?"

Finally finally, can you explain to me a bit about the difference between absolute and relative deterritorialization?\nok sorry, this is too interesting - i've got one more question, that's only semi related. I've heard that Gilbert Simondon was an influence on Giles Deleuze, and all this stuff about 'becoming' certainly sounds related, but could you tell me a little about how specifically Simondon influenced Deleuze's thought?\nok that's great thank you. The other interesting correspondence i've noticed is between Deleuze and Guattari's notion of territory, and Anna Tsing's nonscalability theory. Does she cite them or engage in their work?"

        "prompt": "Can you draft a motion to dismiss?\nDraft a motion to dismiss\nDraft a template for a motion to dismiss\nI want you to draft a motion to dismiss based on the facts I will provide for you.\nJane and Frank Kotter live at 1350 East 85th Street, Brooklyn. They had a good experience leasing a Volkswagen Passat for three years, from 2018 to 2021 from Metro Volkwagen/Audi located on 11th Avenue and 52nd Street in New York City. They recall seeing at least one advertisement for the Passat portraying it as a technologically advanced car that is good for families. On May 1, 2022, they purchased (in Frank\u2019s name) a new Passat for $30,500.00 with a standard three-year / 36,000 mile warranty for repairs and defects. In addition, they also purchased for $500.00 a one-year warranty against transmission failure. VW recommends a vehicle inspection every 10,000 miles and, as with most warranties, any work done at the car is required to be done at an authorized dealership. As was their practice with the leased vehicle, they parked the car on their tree-lined street. On August 1, 2022, Frank changed the car\u2019s oil himself. \n\nOn September 10, 2022, after a heavy rainfall, Frank went to get the car and saw that the interior floor of the vehicle in both the front and rear were flooded with about four inches of water. After many tries, the car would not start. Frank checked the windows and doors of the car, but nothing was open or ajar and there was there was no crack or space through which the water could have entered.\n\nFrank went back home and told Jane about the problem and they decided to call Metro\u2019s service department and have the car towed to Manhattan. The service manager, Josef Schmidt, told them the cost of the tow, $125.00, would be borne by the Kotters. Once the car arrived at the service department, Schmidt told the Kotters that he would call them when he determined the problem and prior to commencing repairs. He called one day later and informed the Kotters that the interior carpets were a total loss and the transmission control module (\u201cTCM\u201d), located under the carpet below the driver\u2019s seat, had to be replaced because it was damaged by the water that entered the vehicle. The total cost of repairs would be $3,790.00 ($1,100.00 for the carpets and $2,690.00 for the TCM). \n\nThe Kotters tried to convince Schmidt that there was a defect and that they did nothing to damage the car or cause the water ingress, and that since they were within the warranty, everything should be covered. Their arguments were unavailing. They also asked if the water entry was an aberration for the Passat, and Schmidt answered that he had heard of such problems and seen it one time. Schmidt told them that he checked with Volkswagen, and their customer service department denied responsibility, saying that the Kotters failed to clear the area below the windshield of leaves and other debris. Left with no other choice, the Kotters reluctantly paid the bill and returned home to Brooklyn.\n\nAfter doing some research on the Internet, the Kotters saw that other Passats also had water entry problems due to a blocked plenum drain, and they decided to seek legal advice.\nThe defendant is Volkswagen and the plaintiffs are the Kotters\nInsert defenses to the following arguments made by the plaintiffs: (1) Breach of express warranty, (2) Breach of implied warranty, (3) common law fraud, and (4) breach of New York General Business Law\nAdd these points to the motion to dismiss you drafted\nCould you cite to relevant case law from the Eastern District of New York?\nAnalogize and/or distinguish these cases to our facts\nIncorporate all of these cases into the motion to dismiss you had drafted before.\nIncorporate all of these cases into the motion to dismiss you had drafted before.

As a Licensed Professional Counselor and Life Coach that is my job to impact individuals and help clients work through emotional difficulties and reach goals. But I will be honest with you I was selling the dream but not always living the dream. I had issues I had not worked completely through like childhood trauma, heartbreak, disappointments, and frustrations with life. Don't get me wrong I had the husband, the kids, the house and the 6 figure job but I was not happy inside, but I didn't change because I hate change, most of us hate change, right? Then I lost my sister, my friend, and it slapped me in the face that I need to take care of myself. I saw the addiction, I saw her not taking care of herself and I could not save her. One thing I know for sure, if you do not make your wellness a priority illness will find you. I remember the moment we lost her, the earth stood still and then my heart broke into pieces, what was I going to do, I have loved her my whole life! It was months later that I made a decision that I would be the change I hope to see, I would create a space for women of color to move past the obstacles that keep us from creating the life we want and Brown Suga Wellness was born. I am on this journey and I invite you to be on this journey with me! I love this quote by Oludara Adeeyo: \"When you heal yourself, you create an earth shattering legacy. The lineage of women who come after you will be healed. Your inner circle of Black women around you, healed.\" When you choose yourself you break generational trauma and curses.

To do that you need mental clarity and a well-crafted plan. The problem is you don\u2019t have time to evaluate hundreds of coaches and companies to piece together a wellness plan that bring you questionable results or don\u2019t cater to your unique needs as a woman of color which makes you feel stuck, overwhelmed, frustrated, invisible, dissatisfied, or unrepresented. We believe you deserve to be fulfilled in your life so we co-create your unique wellness plan. As a black entrepreneur & corporate woman I understand how you feel, I have been exactly where you are and know how frustrating it is to be overwhelmed, underrepresented and invisible without a plan to get better.

So even though we are looking fierce on the outside we are dying inside. We need to be well for our life, but wellness also brings out the very best in us so we can be fulfilled and reach our full potential, this alone is enough to get well. I would to share with you why this subject is so close to my heart, even though I was working in the wellness field, I still loss my sister at the young age of 60 and even though the deaf certificate gives the physical cause of death, I believe her death had more to do with unresolved wellness, the holding of pain and trauma, a battle field in the mind that went unresolved and I tried but I could not save her so I am trying to save myself and I hope you take this journey with me.

It needs to get the yield on its assets much higher than the cost of its deposits so it can make competitive offerings for money. The most effective way to do this would be to write down the asset values of its portfolios so that the yields matched market rates. To do this, would require a substantial amount of equity which as noted on page 1 above requires help from the outside.\nAttractive Bank\nIt should be noted that the bank has some very attractive characteristics:\n\u2022 138,000 high net worth clients.\n\u2022 Customer satisfaction as lead bank is 87% vs 31% for the banking industry.\n\u2022 It grows asset management accounts much faster than the banking industry.\n\u2022 In the past two plus decades its loan losses are almost non-existent at 3 basis points of loans.\n\u2022 Its median home mortgage size is $900,000 with 60% loan-to-value ratios.\n\u2022 The median FICO scores of its homeowners in recent years is 780.\n\u2022 Almost 90% of all loans initiated have were initiated by bakers who have been with the company for more than 35 years.\n\u2022 The bank has carved out numerous niche markets.\n\u2022 The bank has grown with and kept its core clients.\nThus, there are a number of reasons to buy this bank.

Officials have yet to decide on what support they could provide First Republic, if any, and an expansion of the Federal Reserve's offering is one of several options being weighed at this early stage. Regulators continue to grapple with two other failed lenders - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - that\nrequire more immediate attention.

According to Bloomberg News, officials are discussing various options to support First Republic Bank, which is currently facing challenges in shoring up its balance sheet. While the discussions are still in the early stages, any adjustments to the Fed\u2019s liquidity offerings could be designed to benefit First Republic Bank.\n\nDetails on the Expansion of the Emergency Lending Facility\nWhile it is unclear what the expansion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency lending program would entail, the move is likely aimed at providing additional liquidity to banks that are struggling in the current economic climate. The proposed changes would apply to all eligible users, but they may be tailored to ensure that First Republic Bank receives the support it needs to weather the current economic storm.\n\nResponses from Key Players\nRepresentatives from the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and First Republic Bank have declined to comment on the matter. The Federal Reserve has not yet responded to a request for comment from Reuters.\n\nRecord Amounts of Emergency Liquidity Requested\nU.S. banks have been requesting record amounts of emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve in recent weeks. The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have contributed to the increased demand for emergency funds.\n\nMeasures to Support the Banking System\nEarlier this month, President Joe Biden\u2019s economic team worked with regulators to set up measures to support the banking system. This included the creation of a new facility to give banks access to emergency funds and making it easier for banks to borrow from the Fed in times of crisis.\n\nBullish or Bearish for Bank Stocks?\nIt is too early to tell whether the expansion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency lending facility would be bullish or bearish for bank stocks. While the move could provide much-needed liquidity to struggling banks, it could also be seen as a sign of weakness in the banking system. Additionally, if the changes to the Fed\u2019s liquidity offerings are designed to benefit a specific bank, it could be seen as unfair to other lenders. Ultimately, the impact on bank stocks will depend on the specifics of any proposed changes to the emergency lending program.\nFIRST REPUBLIC BANK\nNOTES TO cONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following tables present the carrying values, estimated fair values and the levels in the fair\nvalue hierarchy of financial instruments, excluding those measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis\nDecember 31, 2022\nFair Value\nCarrying\nValue\n(3 in millions)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets:\nCash and casn maturity, net:0\nCash and cash equivalents..\nDebt securities held-to-maturity, net: 0\nU.S. Government-sponsored agency securities\nAgency residential MBS..\nOther residential MBS..\nAgency commercial MBS\nSecurities of U.S. states and political subdivisionsS:\nTax-exempt municipal securities\nTax-exempt nonprofit debentures\nTaxable municipal securities .\nCorporate debt securities.\nLoans, net: 0\n$ 4,283 $ 4,283 $4,283 $\nS\n165\n138\n138\n2,003\n8\n1,753\n7\n1,753\n7\n5,331\n4,663\n4,663\n17,635\n69\n14,765\n69\n22\n69\n14,743\n1,725\n1,412\n1,235\n957\n1,235\n957\nReal estate secured mortgages. ..\nOther loans\n136,793 117,520\n29,291\n84,347 33,173\n26,405\n26,405\nOther assets:\nMSRs..\n11\n379\n26\n379\n26\n379\nFHLB stock.\nLiabilitiesS:\nDeposits:\nCDs\n$ 25,212 $ 25,202 $\n6,700\n7,300\n500\n779\n$\n6,704\n7,050\n498\n$25,202\nShort-term FHLB advances\nLong-term FHLB advances...\nSenior notes\n6,704\n7,050\n498\nSubordinated notes\n621\n621\n0 Carying value is presented net of ACL\n\u4e2d\u6587\n\u4e0d\u8981\u7528\u767e\u4e07\u7ed3\u5c3e \u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4ebf\nFirst Republic Bank $FRC \u2014 part 3\n\\*Since my last article, the price has tanked to 12.18 at the market close (20th March 2023).\n\n\\*I will proceed with this article with the assumption that you\u2019ve read my previous 2:\n\nPart 1: https://medium.com/@victorinvesting/first-republic-bank-frc-may-present-a-good-buying-opportunity-2af489f2aa91\n\nPart 2: https://victorinvesting.medium.com/first-republic-bank-frc-part-2-582565f8aba0\nImage from https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64973321\nDissecting the News Developments:\nOn Sunday, WSJ revealed:\n\nCustomers have pulled some $70 billion in deposits, almost 40% of its total, according to people familiar with the matter. But the withdrawals stabilized Friday, after the country\u2019s biggest banks came to its aid, the people said.\n\nFirst Republic Bank Looms Large for U.S. Regulators After Credit Suisse Sale\nU.S. policy makers warily watched the rushed rescue of Credit Suisse Group AG over the weekend, hoping that its\u2026\nwww.wsj.com\n\nIn my opinion, more deposits may have been pulled since this announcement because:\n\nThe stock plummeted on Monday\nFRC made headlines (yet again), causing further panic\nDepositors' sentiments and general uncertainties\nFurther downgrades by credit agencies\nOf course, it is also entirely possible deposits have remained relatively stable. Also, it is entirely possible that deposits get re-injected in the common weeks/months as the \u201cpanic\u201d and negative sentiment subsides. However, I will assume the worst for now, and a total of 90B have been withdrawn. This figure is calculated by subtracting the 30B deposits (from the 11 banks) from the total value of uninsured deposits (119.5B).\n\nWhat the deposit withdrawal means:\nAssuming 90B was withdrawn, this implies FRC has spent 90B cash as well. Hence the net loss of assets and liabilities cancel each other out. Now, here is the problem I overlooked in part 2 of my article (and I sincerely apologise for this): Now, they have to deleverage.\n\nOn the bright side, however, since my calculation assumes all uninsured deposits are withdrawn, other than the 30B from the 11 big banks, that means the bank doesn\u2019t have to reserve a significant level of additional level of cash to prevent further bank runs as the insured deposits are secure (this is an assumption, and backed with what the company announced in their 8-K), Hence, I will assume they will keep 5B in cash just in case.\n\nAs for the 30B deposits from the 11 major banks, their problem will essentially be pushed back towards the 120 days agreement date. I assume by then, many of the previous deposit withdrawals will return gradually (as I said in my previous article, clients of FRC are loyal and adore their service), if not, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the 11 banks keep it there by discussing new terms.\n\nBorrowings in their Balance Sheet:\nNow for the fun bit\u2026\n\nAssuming 90B was withdrawn, and the bank requires an additional 5B in cash. As 90B and 5B are \u201clocked or gone\u201d, their leftover cash reserve is:\n\n109B federal reserve borrowings + 10B FHLB loan \u2014 95B = 24B\n\nThis 24B leftover cash value will be able to pay off the debt principal and leave us with a short-term debt of 95B in a state of limbo, for now.\nThe problem with this 95B debt is the interest it produces, at 4.75% interest (logically, FRC would pay off the 5.09% FHLB loan first due to its high interest, so the rest will be the federal reserve borrowings at 4.75% interest). This results in an interest payment of 4.5B per year which they cannot sustain since their net income is only 1.67B (This is an oversimplification since the interest expense on deposits will decrease as they are withdrawn, but either way, it\u2019s lower than their net income as their deposit interest expense only accounts for a fraction of their total expense).\n\nHence, there are two scenarios that FRC can take:\n\nScenario 1: Pay off all their debt by selling their assets, many of which are at a loss. This will reduce future interest burden but at the cost of realising the unrealised loss.\nScenario 2: Pay some of the debt just enough for the interest expense to be under the net income so they can still earn positive net income.\nI believe FRC knows what\u2019s the best approach to maximise their profit as they understand their loan books the best. Furthermore, the 8-K revealed that:\n\nThe Bank is focused on reducing its borrowings and evaluating the composition and size of its balance sheet going forward.\n\nThus, I am confident they can manage through this tumultuous period.\n\nScenario 1:\nPaying off the 95B debt + interest by selling their assets (i.e. AFS, HTM, Loan Book (Adjustable, Hybrid, Fixed)).\n\nFirst, what is the interest on the debt for scenario 1?\nI will calculate the 6 months' interest as I presume deposits will flow back in gradually as the panic rests.\n\nIncrease in Interest from borrowings:\n\n95B \\* 4.75% = 4.5125B\nDecrease in Interest from deposits being withdrawn (deposits at 0.99% interest)\n\n90B \\* 0.99% = 0.891B\nNet increase in interest:\n\n4.5125\u20130.891 = 3.62B\n\nSo, FRC has to pay 3.62B in interest assuming they pay back their borrowings 6 months from now. Hence, the total debt + interest to pay is 98.62B.\n\nAvailable-for-sale (AFS):\n\nAssuming another 2% loss since 31st December, their fair value can be sold at 3.28B, with an assets loss of 67M.\n\nDebt to pay = 98.62B-3.28B = 95.34B left\n\nHeld-to-Maturity (HTM):\n\nAssuming another 4% loss since 31st December on their HTM assets, this implies a proceed of 22.64B, and an assets loss of 5.7B.\n\nDebt to pay = 95.34B-22.64B = 72.7B\n\nAdjustable Loans:\nPer their 10\u2013K:\n\nThe Bank\u2019s loan portfolio includes: (1) adjustable-rate loans tied to Prime, LIBOR, COFI Repl Index (which is based on Federal COFI plus/minus a spread adjustment equal to the five-year historical median spread between COFI and Federal COFI), and other reference rates, including a 12-month average of 1-year CMT, which are currently adjustable; (2) hybrid-rate loans, for which the initial rate is fixed for a period from one year to as many as ten years, and thereafter the rate becomes adjustable; and (3) fixed-rate loans, for which the interest rate does not change through the life of the loan.\n31.16B of Adjustable Rate at a 3% loss implies a proceed of 30.23B and a net assets loss of 935M.\n\nDebt to pay = 72.7B-30.23B = 42.47B\n\nHybrid Loans:\nAssuming a 15% loss for every Hybrid loan that the bank sells:\n\nBy selling 42.47B worth of Hybrid loans to pay off their short-term borrowings:\n\nAssets loss = (42.47/(1\u20130.15))-42.47 = 7.5B loss\n\nIn summary, the total net asset loss is 67M + 5.7B + 935M +7.5B = 14.2B\n\nThankfully, we haven\u2019t tapped into fixed-rate loans yet.\n\nValuations:\nVery Bearish Case:\nAssuming FRC encountered a loss of 13.27B\n\n187M shares = common + preferred\n\nTBV = (212,639\u2013195,193\u2013218\u201314200)/187 = $16.19\n\nFirst of all, the risk of a fire sale is very possible, and we have no control over this, so again, my articles are not financial advice, please please please do your own research and I want to especially stress that this is a very speculative and risky bet!\n\nSecond of all, the assumptions stated in this assumption are very pessimistic (although not the worst case, i.e. fire-sale or nuclear war). This assumes that all uninsured deposits are withdrawn (other than the 30B from the 11 Major Banks). If we use even 80B instead of the 90B figure for the deposit withdrawn:\n\nThis leaves a \u201cdebt to pay\u201d figure of 83.62B. And after assuming AFS, HTM and adjustable rate loans are sold, this leaves an outstanding \u201cdebt to pay\u201d figure of 83.62\u20133.28\u201322.64\u201330.23 = 27.47B. This is covered by selling 32.3B worth of Hybrid loans at a 15% discount, translating to an asset loss of 4.84B from the balance sheet. So in summary, this leaves a net assets loss of 67M + 5.7B + 935M + 4.84B = 11.542B, hence:\n\nTBV = (212,639\u2013195,193\u2013218\u201311,542)/187 = $30.4\n\nBasis Case (Assuming Sunday\u2019s figures remain unchanged):\nIf we only assume 70B deposits have left like on Sunday, and the bank has to pay an interest of 3.62B. This leaves a \u201cdebt to pay\u201d figure of 73.62B.\n\nAfter adjusting for AFS, HTM, and Adjustable loans, this leaves a \u201cdebt to pay\u201d outstanding figure of 73.62\u20133.28\u201322.64\u201330.23 = 17.47B. This produces an asset loss of 3.08B assuming a 15% discount on their Hybrid loans. This leaves a net asset loss of 67M + 5.7B + 935M + 3.08B = 9.782B.\n\nTBV = (212,639\u2013195,193\u2013218\u20139782)/187 = $39.8\n\nTakeaway:\nThe difference between a TBV of $39.8, $30.4 and $16.19 is stark and it all has to do with how much of the Hybrid Loans they tap into, this depends on how many deposits have been withdrawn. In my opinion, I believe deposits will return once the panic subsides (we will see if other banks announce further rescue deals in the coming days, and a plausible Fed rate pause). As deposits return, this will have a multiplier effect on the share price by allowing more cash reserves to pay off their short-term federal reserve borrowings. Hence, Their goal now is to introduce confidence back to their depositors.\n\nAssumptions:\nThere haven\u2019t been any updates on the 70B credit facility with JPM, so I cannot speculate on this.\nPrivate Share Offering\nInability or failure to raise equity. Again, there\u2019s very limited info on this and may only be rumours or fake news, I will delve into this when there\u2019s more info, however.\nRisks I mentioned in Parts 1 & 2\nFire-sale risk, take under risks\nRegulatory risks\nAgain, I want to stress this is a highly risky bet so please be careful!\nClosing Comment:\nI hope you enjoyed the article!

FRC stock has whiplashed ever since and the bank has seen significant deposit outflows in the days following the bank failure of Silicon Valley Bank. A series of 8K disclosures were meant to reassure investors that First Republic Bank has sufficient liquidity to manage a heightened level of deposit outflows, but investors have chosen to bet against the bank and they clearly expect the worst to happen. I continue to believe that First Republic Bank is not at risk of going out of business and that the common stock potentially offers very risk-tolerant investors triple-digit return potential!\n\nRisk control and asymmetric upside potential\nTo account for extraordinarily high levels of volatility in the financial market, I have chosen to take a very small position in First Republic Bank: FRC accounts for just about 1.05% of my investment portfolio which chiefly consists of non-financial stocks. Given the asymmetric risk profile that I see with brutalized community banks, I believe investors could earn multiples of their investment here... if fears subside and confidence returns to the community banking sector. However, there is a chance that First Republic Bank might be shut down or be forced to do a highly dilutive capital raise which would likely seriously impair the remaining value of the equity. Therefore, investors must recognize that there is the potential to lose the entire investment if things turn south.\n\nLiquidity update, estimated deposit outflows and 8K disclosures\nSince my last call to consider FRC in the midst of the banking bloodbath, shares of First Republic have revalued lower by about 60%. However, the bank has made a number of 8K disclosures throughout the banking crisis that were meant to inform investors about the strategic actions the community bank has been taking.\n\nIt all started with an 8K disclosure dated March 12, 2023 in which First Republic Bank announced that it secured additional liquidity from the Federal Reserve Bank and JPMorgan Chase & Co which brought its unused liquidity to a massive $70B. Undoubtedly, huge deposit outflows forced the company to bolster its cash position.\n\nJust days later, on March 16, 2023, First Republic Bank announced that eleven lenders banded together and deposited a combined $30B into the bank (8K source) in order to signal confidence in First Republic Bank's liquidity situation. This move also failed to calm investors and the lender\u2019s shares have continued to sell off since.\n\nAdditionally, last week, First Republic Bank announced that a number of executives have agreed to reduce their annual bonuses to zero for 2023 while others have forfeited vesting all performance-based incentives (Source). The latest 8K, dated March 22, 2023, was meant to instill confidence in the bank yet again and align shareholder and executive interests. Since shares continued to fall last week, it is safe to say that the latest measures have not yet had a positive effect on investor sentiment.\n\nFRC's business banking business and recent news about deposit outflows\nWhat was First Republic Bank\u2019s strength before the crisis, its banking business, has become its major weakness. The bank\u2019s focus on venture banking -- taking in deposits from venture capital-backed companies and making loans to them -- has revealed an unforeseen vulnerability after Silicon Valley Bank shut its doors. The key problem with SVB was not deteriorating credit quality, but rather that the bank was forced to liquidate its bond portfolio at a significant loss in order to fund deposit outflows. Most banks now have unrealized investment losses, according to JP Morgan, including First Republic Bank... which is not a big issue of these assets don't have to be sold. Additionally, FRC's capital position is not necessarily much worse than those of other community banks.\n\nSource: JP Morgan\nSource: JP Morgan\n\nA potential solution to the crisis\nSince First Republic Bank has a considerable focus on business clients -- 63% of its deposits came from its venture banking business which are at a higher risk of leaving the bank due to the FDIC\u2019s $250,000 insurance limit -- the bank has seen considerable deposit outflows. The bank said in its 8K disclosure for March 16, 2023 that \u201cdaily deposit outflows have slowed considerably\u201d which is also what U.S. officials have remarked on lately. About 79% of First Republic Bank's deposits were uninsured as of the end of FY 2022. Before the crisis, First Republic Bank's business deposits were growing steadily and according to the bank's Q4'22 update, the bank had exceptionally good credit quality, too.\n\nSource: First Republic Bank\nSource: First Republic Bank\n\nHowever, my guess is that the bank will sell a portion of its loan book in order to raise cash which would the best solution for First Republic Bank, and certainly preferable over an equity raise. The bank owned $166.9B in loans at the end of the December-quarter which mostly were collateralized by real estate. I can see FRC selling a portion of its loans at a fair price to larger banks in a big to shore up its balance sheet.\n\nSource: First Republic Bank\nSource: First Republic Bank\n\nFirst Republic: Deposit losses and impact on valuation\nFirst Republic Bank is by far the worst performing community bank, largely due to its high percentage (79%) of uninsured deposits and the need to raise $30B in additional deposits from other companies.\n\nChart\nData by YCharts\nIt is impossible to know precisely at this point how many deposits First Republic Bank has lost, but the Wall Street Journal, citing insiders, said the bank has lost about half of its deposit base, which would calculate to about $70B.\n\nThis means that FRC is also going to report at a significant decline in its book value in Q1\u201923. First Republic Bank reported a book value of $75.38 at the end of FY 2022. Assuming a 50% decline in book value, chiefly due to deposit outflows and a shrinking balance sheet resulting from the crisis in the financial sector, FRC may report a BV around $37-38 per-share at the end of the first-quarter. Of course, more aggressive assumptions about deposit losses would translate into even higher book value declines. A, say, 60% decrease in cash/deposits implies, roughly speaking, a 60% decline in book value\u2026 which could put the Q1\u201923 BV closer to $30 per-share. Since First Republic Bank\u2019s shares are trading at $12.36, the valuation implies an 84% discount to BV. If deposits indeed declined by 60%, then the valuation may more accurately reflect a 59% discount to book value.\n\nFRC offers by far the biggest book value discount and therefore also has the highest perceived risk. However, fear clearly is present here and investors may overestimate the decline of FRC's deposit base.\n\nChart\nData by YCharts\nRisks with First Republic Bank\nIf deposit outflows continue, the big banks might decide that it is a better idea to convert the $30B in deposits into equity, which of course would heavily dilute shareholders. First Republic Bank has enough liquidity, in my opinion, through the Bank Term Funding Program, the FED\u2019s discount window and other banks, so I don't believe the bank couldn't fund incremental deposit withdrawals. What would change my mind about FRC is if the company would have to liquidate (a portion of) its bond holding portfolio and realize losses, or if the bank would do a dilutive equity offering.\n\nFinal thoughts\nFirst Republic Bank remains a high-risk, high-potential rebound stock in the community banking market, despite the stock being down dramatically since I took my initially position more than a week ago. The reason why I am sticking to my guns here is that I consider it highly unlikely that the FED will allow fear and panic to spread in the financial market as it has learned the lessons from 2008 financial crisis. This lesson is that failing to provide a liquidity backstop will eventually lead to a crisis much bigger, much harder to control and much more expensive than the initial, forceful intervention. First Republic Bank likely has suffered very considerable deposit outflows since I last covered the stock, but recent liquidity measures have proven to support the bank while deposit outflows appear to have stabilized lately. With the stock now trading at an 84% discount to book value, I believe investors continue to face a very attractive trading opportunity!\n\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f53\u5c40\u6b63\u5728\u8003\u8651\u6269\u5927\u7d27\u6025\u8d37\u6b3e\u673a\u5236 2023 \u5e74 3 \u6708 26 \u65e5\uff0c\u636e\u5f6d\u535a\u793e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f53\u5c40\u6b63\u5728\u8003\u8651\u6269\u5927\u7d27\u6025\u8d37\u6b3e\u673a\u5236\u3002\u636e\u77e5\u60c5\u4eba\u58eb\u900f\u9732\uff0c\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8 3 \u6708 13 \u65e5\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u8d37\u6b3e\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8c03\u6574\u662f\u5f53\u5c40\u6700\u8fd1\u51e0\u5929\u6743\u8861\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4f9b\u5e94\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u6269\u5927\u90fd\u5c06\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7b26\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u8fd9\u7b26\u5408\u94f6\u884c\u6cd5\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\u5fc5\u987b\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u7279\u5b9a\u94f6\u884c\u3002\u4f46\u77e5\u60c5\u4eba\u58eb\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u53d8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7b2c\u4e00\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\n\u6295\u8d44frc\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e"

Could you expand on that a little how and where to plan that? We are staying in a hotel near Termini station and will be visiting Rome next Saturday and Sunday?\nCould you expand a bit more on the location?\nI think these locations are a bit too crowded and not suitable for my wife during her pregnancy. Please provide other options\nThanks. If we have one hour for the photoshoot, do you have any suggestions as how to fill that hour, maybe some creative directions as well?\nAround Villa Borghese what would be good places to shoot the photos?

Religion points out your flaws and perpetuates discouragement. Religion makes people feel better than others because they go to \u201cchurch\u201d.. I am however inlove with the one who created me. I believe Jesus is the savior of humanity and that his love is what changes us.. I believe that the brokenness of humanity pains God and that he sent an answer and provided hope in Jesus.. my advice is to steer clear of religion, but put your hope in the eternal one who died an excruciating death so that you and i could truly live on for eternity. This is what I believe and it has brought me extraordinary peace through the pains of this broken planet. This truth helps me to let go and not store treasures here on earth. I believe this pain wont last forever, one day i will be in heaven where there is no pain or suffering but until then i live by faith and not by sight.\"\nGive a hypothetical response that would be made by St. Thomas Aquinas.\nThis is in the spirit of how St. Thomas would respond, but could you rewrite in the more formal style of his writings like the Summa?\nThis is good. Now rather than writing it as a direct response to the Instagram post, could you write it in the form of an Article in the Summa on whether one should \"steer clear of religion\" in order to better follow Jesus, with objections, an \"on the contrary\" statement, and an \"I answer that\" paragraph?\nCould you give an alternative \"On the contrary\" that involves a scriptural reference? Thomas's most common way of doing so involves an appeal to authority, before he gives a more detailed argument in the \"I answer that\".\nCan you now write a dialogue between the celebrity (who is Justin Bieber, by the way) and St. Thomas Aquinas on this topic?"

What kind of software are best suited for that?\nok. it is important to identify pronom id. We are able to code and integrate libraries our self. Our prefered language is java. Any recommandations?\nok. please tell me more about tika. i like code examples also. is it possible to use inputstreams instead of files?\nthanks. i am not interessted in text extraction. Could you please show me an example of output of metadata from a inputstream containing av pdf?\nok. are tika able to validate files?\nok. what is the difference of Tika an Fits?\nis it possible to use inputstreams in Fits?\ntell me more about the Java-based api of Fits\nplease show me an example of the content in FitsOutput\nplease continue last answear\nplease continue\nThanks. Could you please summarize whats best suited for file format identification and validation?\nCould you summarize details about Jhove as a open source project?\nOK. Could you provide me a suggestion for a software solution for ingesting large amounts of files for digital preservation? We are comfortable to code ourself, but prefer using widely used open source components. The solution should be scalable and run on premise. We need to file format identification, file validation and metadata extraction. We would also like to maintain metadata about the files in a database, as well as creating METS files with Premis and technical metadata. Please suggest the best solution for us.\nok. Is using Apache NiFi a possible solution?\nplease continue\ncontinue\nis there a TikaProcessor. Please tell me more about it\nsure. we could write some processors our self with javacode. Which processors do we need to make our self, to get a good integration with other tools?\nWe would like to store all data used to create the mets files, so that its easy to change the metadata and recreate the mets files. what database is best suited to store the different metadata? are RDBMS or nosql best for this purpose?\ncould you please provide me an example of mongodb collections and metadata structures suited for storing this information?\nplease continue\ncontinue\nplease suggest how to track changes for recreating the mets files\nHow could i map the xml output from many of the tools to the mongodb collections?\ncontinue"

        "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking\nCan you underline the epidemiological aspects of inconsistency derived by ideology thinking?\nExpand on the risks that ideological thinking poses to national security.\nAre there countries where ideological thinking is more widespread?\nName one country in the west where ideological thinking is more widespread than the average.\nIn which measure ideological thinking is widespread in the USA?\nWhat are the main historical roots of ideological thinking in the USA.\nExpand on the religious roots.\nName the role of specific religions in shaping ideological thinking in the USA.\nWhat about the influence of protestantism.\nWhat about evangelism?\nCreate an essay using all the above.\nTell me something about ideological thinking in Italy during the 70'.\nExpand\nWhat are the ideological roots of anti establishment and counterculture movements.\nhow the belief in the power of individual action and expression could be sustained if one of the main political reference of these movements were communist regimes?\nIn fact the most important slogan of Mario Capanna quoted von Moltke: \"Let's march divided to strike united\". But what society was supposed to be built after a successful strike carried out by those different actors?\nAnd this is the point! That was just rebellion, the idea that simply by breaking down the structurer of the state you can get a better society. Which is a naivety that is understandable in the youngsters but is a despicable attitude in the adults. In fact we have to think that \"adults\" used that naivety to advance their agenda, that to say breaking down the structure of the state to advance the communist Russia interests.\nThey may had held a variety of political beliefs and goals, but by \"striking united\" they objectively weakened their country national interest and advanced the Soviet Union interests, which was seeking to bring about caos so that the nation could be healed only by the communist order.\nSo they were diverse but united in the disinterest fro the risks carried by their political actions.\nI mean, if you \"strike\" the enemy along with other people you are objectively and collectively responsible for the consequences of such \"strike\". That is true even if your goals may differ. I would say that not to agree to the meaning, or the goal, of that \"strike\", and carrying on \"marching\" together is a moral bankruptcy.\nYep, I am considering the diversity, and also the importance of letting ideas and energies flow, but the desire and the acts of breaking down the state without agreeing on the goal appears morally questionable.\nYou are always balanced, many compliments.\nI would like you to write the detailed outline of a story of loss that starts in the 70 in Italy. The story of two friends (use two Italian names) whose long friendship was finally destroyed because one of them took too much refuge in ideological thinking. Underline the difficulty of dealing with a person full of hatred for the culture in which he lives, and the inconsistency of wanting to change everything without a clear idea of the goals or the means to get to that goal. Please strive to create a connection with the moral bankruptcy of pockets of the movements of the 70 (like Autonomia Operaia), underlining how that same bankruptcy that was understandable when the two characters were in their teens, becomes despicable when they get to 60 years of age. Also, as another broad context, you can base the outline on my general assumption that the moral bankruptcy that is plaguing the left that choses to side with Russia in its aggression to Ukraine, is directly related to that original moral bankruptcy, the \"marching divided to strike united\" without a declared common goal. This relation to the original bankruptcy it to be considered in general: if you has always been morally irresponsible, than it is likely that ideology will force you to take side with the evil, even when you have all the hints that tell you that that siding is despicable. There is also a psychological aspect that reinforce that possibility of siding with the evil, that to say the childish and narcissistic assumption by one of the characters (and its culture of reference) of being fundamentally good and just in a world where the all rest is wrong and stupid.\nUse the dry style of Hemingway."

Can we go through the original poem three lines at a time and write a modern version of it?\nNice. Can we go through the original poem three lines at a time and write a modern version of it? Can you start by showing me the first three lines of the original poem, starting from \"Let us go...\"?\nShow me just the first three lines of the original poem\nGreat! Here are the first two lines of my revision:\n\nLet us go then, you and I,\nWhere the screen glows bright against the sky\nCan you suggest some third lines that have the same scansion as \"Like a patient etherized upon a table\"?\nHow many syllables are in \"Like a patient etherized upon a table\"?\ne-ther-ized is 3 syllables, not 4\nGreat. Can you suggest some third lines for the revised poem that likewise have 12 syllables?\nGood. Now give me suggestions that include a simile to a single object or concept from modern life, not a plural one like multitude.\nOK but remember, the simile is comparing something to \"a screen glowing brightly against the sky.\" So the suggested lines should be metaphors for a glowing screen.\nNeon sign is good. How about \"Like a neon haze of something something\"?\nCan you complete the line \"like a neon haze\" with something concrete instead of abstract? \"Endless information\" is an abstraction, not visualizable. I'd like to replace it with something concrete that could be visualized as a neon haze.\nYes. Give me 10 more suggestions. Remember that the words following neon haze should be 4 syllables total.\nScratch all that. I like \"billboards.\" Let's go wtih \"Like a neon haze of something billboards.\" Can you suggest some 2-syllable words that could plausibly describe a bright billboard?"
