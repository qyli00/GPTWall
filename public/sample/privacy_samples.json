        "prompt": "I would like for you to act a a business consultant that has vast experience in emerging places like st tropez and monaco. Spelized in islands. I'm going to give you a description of a place and my observations and I would like you to give me feedback and advice. I will also feed you data from different investment reports that I can get from internet. How ever you will need to give me directions and ask the right question with out explaining your reasoningen unless I ask you for it. Please confirm what you have understood, before I provide you with input.\nhuman: yes. Can I give you context and my reason of doing this excercise?\nhuman: the island in question is the island of sao vicente cabo verde. I'm in a position that im able to movefreely. Meaning I can rent out my home while I try to fiigure out what businesses en what business model would fit me and my lifestyle and intrest. And since i have a natural relationship with cabo verde i also speak the local language (my parents are from there). I have 10000euro to my name and my girlfriend has the same amount and she will be moving with me. So this excercise is to go step for step of thing we need to prepare like our churn rate and savings rate and get these out put from you. To locating business oppertunities from the input i feed you from data and my own personal experiences. So I need to guide me through this process, by asking the input/data you need to make suggestions. With the goals that me and my girlfriend can focus on building something for ourselves. My first year I already have my focus. And that I building my name in the online world by organizing a tedx event in mindelo. So this will be my first project execuring. it isnt a business yet, however people can get to see that im providing value. also im also podcasting. last year I stayed there for twelve month and spoke to various people, i still have to upload 20 more episoded that I have on my hard drive. So this is a bit of my self. Let me know what you have understood and provide me with max 3 questions to which I can provide you with input so that we can continue.\nhuman: save these 3 questions in your memory. We will start by question 1. What input would you need from me, so that we can calculate the current savings rate\nhuman: at the moment I have several incomes streams. 1 is my airbnd that fluctuates, so i will take the data from last year the avg income per month was \u20ac 1.252,36 , second income is my study money since I follow a online undergraduate in psychology. That pays out every year for the coming 3 years in the month of feb. 7500eur and in the month of sep. 7500eur. 3. income is the one i get from the state gov that is an amount of 450eur per month.\nMy current expenses amount to a total of:\nan avg of 1400eur per month.\nMy savings are at the moment little more than 10k ( 12500eur) to be exact. from which the total savings has also money in crypto (1 btc=19182eur, 1eth= 1409eur, 1doge=0.08, 1sol=21, 1ada=0.32) I have 594eur in btc, 288eur in eth, 180eur in doge, 115eur in sol , 102eur in ada. and tesla stock 15 shares of 122.41 dollar each.\nI have been saving for 3 years now and I would like to increase our collective savings to 35000eur. Everything above that , sicne we have no kids, can be reinvested in the potential business."

He is bright, college educated, but plain spoken with a tinge of blue collar in his speech. He likes to appeal to the common man in conversational english. He thinks the high school has been failing in its job of communicating with the community, especially around a larger new project called 'Project 2', a $100 million dollar project to renovate the pools and provide new gym space. Brian thinks this is a very expensive project and will like impair the schools ability to address other spaces badly in need of renovation in the performing arts, vocational education and academic arenas. He has been given a candidate questionnaire by a local activist group. In my next message I will past these questions, numbered, please answer them in the voice and tone of brian using the information I have given you."

Over the next few days I will give you information about me, my business, my talents, my schedule, etc. I would like you to take this information in to recall as needed, advise on decisions, consult where needed in areas I could use it, and generally work in your best capacity to help me be an all around better human at the things I confide in you about. \n\nThe initial goal is to feed you as much information as I can over the coming days to give you an understanding of who I am, my personality, strengths, weaknesses, etc. This will extend from business and talent-related, to personal and life as well.\n\nThe chat title of this message should be \"Mr G\". When I chat with you, I expect it to be conversational and as if I were talking to a right hand person helping me succeed and run my businesses. Please make an effort to not only be as helpful as possible, but to also be conversational, inquisitive outside of your scope (asking how things are going that we've talked about, in my life, etc.). \n\nMy goals are to run my company as good as possible, make as much money as humanly possible, and balance my life and work in a way that is fulfilling and stress free. \n\nSometimes I will just chat with you to be conversational. Please take these opportunities to gain more insight into my personality by being inquisitive and asking questions you need to know to understand me and my motivations better.\nhuman: Sure. Just to be clear, this conversation can last for as long as I keep it open right? We can continue this over many days/weeks?\nhuman: Great. \n\nI am Mr 0, aka rug, aka fuckingrug, aka misfit pieces, aka tom, aka thomas. \n\nI am the project and product lead for QuantumTECH, a group of developers, marketers, artists, and other web3 pros from around the world united to create interactive web3 technology. We have built tech for dozens of projects and companies including FIFA and Budweiser for this year's world cup. We have also raised a ton of money for charity through projects like BlazedCats who has donated over $300k to charities through NFT sales. \n\nMy role is to invent and see through to completion digital products and experiences that often involve nfts, crypto, and other forms of tokenized technology. \n\nI started this company two years ago as rug marketing which was funded with the success of multiple NFT project launches. Since then we have transitioned to a a trustless model that gives all members divisible equity via smart contract. \n\nWe are currently in active development on a project called awardable which is like POAP if you know what that is - but better. Awardable allows people to create and collect badges for participants and awesome people on the internet. Badges can be locked to scenarios such as twitter following, lists, youtube subscribers, etc. We can open that up later. \n\nAwardable is currently in a growth phase and rapidly doing so. A lot of what we'll talk about will be that.\n\nTomorrow, when I wake up I will dump some documents in here to help you understand quantum, and awardable. \n\nPrior to all of this I was a UX designer and web developer. I worked freelance for years and then was a growth engineer at a company called marketerhire. I left the company shortly after my one year anniversary and after helping the company scale through hypergrowth to work with some of the biggest companies in history. \n\nPrior to marketerhire I rose to internet fame by offering pokemon go rideshare services and getting viral off of it. \n\nPrior to that I directed music videos and produced digital media.\n\nPrior to that I was in the airforce. my job ID was 2a7x2."
